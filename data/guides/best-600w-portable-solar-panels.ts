  {
    "criterion": "Fold unit versus array",
    "explanation": "A single folding 600W unit sets up in minutes and goes in a trunk, while six modules take a build but fit curved roofs. Decide whether the panels will travel or stay. Check how the listing says it connects."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage and controller",
    "explanation": "A 12V array of 18V panels needs a charge controller sized to the amps, and a 42.5V panel needs a station that accepts it. Read the station or controller input limit. Match them before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real 600W output",
    "explanation": "Expect 360 to 480 watts in strong sun, less in heat. The station's solar input cap may be lower still. Choose a size that your station can use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length and connectors",
    "explanation": "A 4.5 m cable keeps the station in shade, and a 30A Anderson plug carries current well. Check the cable list. A short cable forces the station into the sun."
  },
