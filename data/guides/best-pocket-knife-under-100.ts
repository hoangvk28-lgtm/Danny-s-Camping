    "criterion": "What $100 buys",
    "explanation": "Every knife here costs well under $100, and the extra money mostly buys brand and finish. At about $15 you get a basic folder, and at about $30 you get D2 or newer steel and a G10 handle. Compare steel and lock instead of price alone."

  {
    "criterion": "Blade steel",
    "explanation": "D2 holds an edge well and resists rust moderately, while 14C28N resists rust better and sharpens easily. CPM-MagnaCut is a high-end stainless. Look for the named steel on the listing, and be wary of listings that say only stainless."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lock type",
    "explanation": "A liner lock, a crossbar lock or a lock-back holds the blade open under pressure. A knife without a stated lock is a risk. Look for the lock named on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Handle material",
    "explanation": "G10 grips well wet or dry, nylon is cheaper and aluminum is light but slippery. For camp use, textured G10 is the safe choice. Look for the handle material on the listing."

  {
    "criterion": "Blade length and laws",

    "q": "Is D2 steel better than 14C28N?",
    "a": "D2 holds an edge longer, and 14C28N resists rust better and sharpens easily. For wet trips, the VIRENKNIFE 14C28N suits. For edge life, the KLAKEN Virex suits."

  {
    "q": "How do I open and close a liner-lock knife safely?",
