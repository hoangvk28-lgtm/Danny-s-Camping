export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Wet-weather performance",
    "explanation": "Synthetic fill keeps most of its loft when damp, which down does not. That matters in rain, snow and tent condensation. The Kelty Cosmic listing says its Cirroloft insulation keeps working in cold and damp conditions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "Synthetic is bulkier than down for the same warmth. The Kelty Cosmic lists 4 lb 6 oz in Regular and a 17 by 11 inch stuff size. Compare listed weights before you commit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort versus label",
    "explanation": "A 0 degree label is not a comfort promise. The WKFAMOUT prints 30 degrees F comfort, which is a better planning number. Look for a comfort line in the details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad integration",
    "explanation": "Body weight crushes insulation under you, so a bag with a pad sleeve like the Big Agnes Echo Park keeps you centered. This helps if you roll off your pad. Check the sleeve fits your pad width."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit by height",
    "explanation": "Too short a bag compresses fill at your feet. The Kelty Cosmic offers Regular to 6 ft and Long to 6 ft 6 in, and the WKFAMOUT fits to 6 ft 7 in. Match length to your height."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is synthetic better than down for 0 degrees?",
    "a": "It is better in damp weather because it keeps loft when wet. Down packs smaller and weighs less. The Kelty Cosmic Synthetic 0F is the more portable of these three."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are these truly 0 degree bags?",
    "a": "They are labeled that way. The WKFAMOUT 0 Degree Envelope prints a 30 degree F comfort rating, so plan around that kind of figure."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Big Agnes worth the price?",
    "a": "Only if you want the Padlok pad sleeve and extra room. The Kelty Cosmic Synthetic 0F is lighter and cheaper. Pad compatibility matters for the Big Agnes."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I zip two bags together?",
    "a": "Match the zipper sides and make sure both bags are the same model line. The WKFAMOUT 0 Degree Envelope and Big Agnes Echo Park 0 both list mating zippers. Test at home first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a synthetic bag?",
    "a": "Keep it uncompressed on a hanger or in a large sack. Compressing it for months flattens the loft. Wash per the care label."
