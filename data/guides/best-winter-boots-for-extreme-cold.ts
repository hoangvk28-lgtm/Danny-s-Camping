  "Six boots were compared on listed temperature ratings, liner construction, shell and height, and traction. Five state a rating or an insulation weight. One has no rating at all, and its entry says so, since a fur lining without a rating is a cold-weather boot, not an extreme-cold one."

  {
    "criterion": "Rated temperature",
    "explanation": "A comfort rating is the lowest temperature at which a boot is claimed to keep feet comfortable while active. Ratings vary by brand method, so they are a guide rather than a promise. Look for a stated rating and be cautious of boots that give none."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Liner type",
    "explanation": "A removable liner can be pulled out and dried overnight, which matters when sweat freezes inside the boot. A fixed liner stays damp longer. Check whether the listing names a removable liner."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell and seams",
    "explanation": "A rubber or seam-sealed shell keeps meltwater out, while a water-resistant fabric upper soaks through. Wet feet in deep cold lead to quick heat loss. Look for rubber, seam-sealed or 100 percent waterproof wording."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shaft height",
    "explanation": "A tall shaft or snow collar blocks snow and holds heat around the calf. A short bootie lets cold air and snow in at the top. Check the shaft height in inches or a collar description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standing vs moving",
    "explanation": "Warmth ratings assume activity, and standing still in the cold needs far more insulation. Ice fishing or waiting on a stand calls for the lowest rating. Choose by the least active thing you will do."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Boot weight and fit",
    "explanation": "Heavy rubber boots tire legs on long walks, and a tight fit cuts circulation and cold feet. Leave room for thick socks and check size advice such as sizing up. Read the size note before ordering."

];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What rating does extreme cold need?",
    "a": "It depends on activity, but a stated rating at or below -25 F is a common starting point for harsh winters. The Muck Arctic Pro, Kamik Nation Plus and Kamik Alborg state lower ratings."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with extreme-cold boots?",
    "a": "Wearing tight boots with thick socks. Pressure cuts circulation and makes feet colder. Size up or choose a roomier fit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is an expensive extreme-cold boot worth it?",
    "a": "If you stand still in deep cold, yes, since low ratings matter then. The Muck Arctic Pro is built for that. For short outings, the NORTIV 8 Men's Insulated is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep feet dry inside?",
    "a": "Wear moisture-wicking socks and dry removable liners overnight, as the Kamik Alborg allows. Avoid cotton. Change socks if they get damp."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for rubber and leather cold boots?",
    "a": "Rinse mud, dry at room temperature and avoid direct heat. Treat leather like the Kamik Alborg's nubuck upper regularly. Check seams for cracks."
