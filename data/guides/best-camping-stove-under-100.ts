export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "One burner or two",
    "explanation": "A single burner cooks one pot at a time, which suits couples and solo trips. A second burner means dinner and a side dish at the same time. If you cook for three or more, the Triton's two burners are worth the premium."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated output",
    "explanation": "Ratings of about 7,500 to 10,000 BTU boil water in a few minutes, but higher output also uses more fuel, and wind steals more of the heat. A two-burner stove spreads its output across two flames, so each burner is gentler than a single hot one. Compare BTU figures on the listing and match them to your pots."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind guards",
    "explanation": "A wind guard shields the flame and cuts the time it takes to boil, since a breeze can double cooking time on an open burner. The Triton lists two wind guards, one for each burner. Look for guard or windshield wording on the listing, and carry a foil screen if you buy a stove without one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel type",
    "explanation": "Propane works in cold weather and comes in large cylinders, while butane is compact but weakens when temperatures drop. A stove that suits your fuel will save you a trip to the store. Pick the fuel that matches your coldest trip and the canisters sold near your campsite."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Simmer control",
    "explanation": "A stove that cannot turn down will scorch rice and eggs. Independent knobs on a two-burner stove make this easier. Look for adjustable flame wording and see how the knob is described."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "What the budget really buys",
    "explanation": "At $50 to $100, you are paying for a second burner, a sturdier grate and better wind protection. Below $30, you are buying a basic burner. Decide which of those extras you will use."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a two-burner stove worth it?",
    "a": "If you cook for three or more, yes. Two independent burners let you fry and boil at once. For a couple, a single burner is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "Propane or butane for camping?",
    "a": "Propane works better in cold weather and suits bigger stoves, while butane is compact but weak below freezing. For summer camping either is fine. Choose by your coldest trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a wind guard?",
    "a": "Yes in open sites. The Triton includes two wind guards, and many single burners do not. A foil or folding windscreen helps if your stove lacks one."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I light and use the stove?",
    "a": "Open the lid, connect the fuel and turn the knob while using the ignition or a lighter. Use the stove outdoors on a stable surface, and keep it away from tents."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean and store a camp stove?",
    "a": "Let it cool, remove the grate and wipe it with soapy water. Disconnect the fuel and store the stove dry. Keep canisters upright and cool."
