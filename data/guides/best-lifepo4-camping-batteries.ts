    "criterion": "BMS current rating",
    "explanation": "The built-in battery management system sets the maximum continuous current, such as 20A or 100A. A 15Ah pack with a 20A BMS cannot run a 300W load, since that would pull around 25A at 12V. Match the BMS rating to your largest load, and check it in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging below freezing",
    "explanation": "Lithium iron phosphate cells can be damaged by charging below 32 degrees F, so a BMS cutoff or a self-heating function protects them. Without it, charging stops or, in a poorly protected battery, harms the cells. Look for low-temperature charge protection in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chemistry and charger match",
    "explanation": "A lithium battery wants a lithium charge profile around 14.4V to 14.6V, not a lead-acid profile with equalization. Many solar controllers and chargers have a lithium setting. Check your charger before buying, and use correctly sized wire and a fuse."
