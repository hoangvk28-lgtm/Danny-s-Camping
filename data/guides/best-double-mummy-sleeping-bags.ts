  {
    "criterion": "Heat control in a double",
    "explanation": "Independent vents, a hood and a draft tube help two sleepers manage heat. These features offset some of the lost taper. Check the listing for each by name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Two singles as an alternative",
    "explanation": "Two mummy bags with matching zippers can be joined. That gives a tapered cut for each sleeper. Check zipper sides and sizes before you buy."
