export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What makes a tent 4 season",
    "explanation": "A true 4 season tent has stronger poles, a fly that reaches the ground and a snow skirt to block spindrift. Ventilation is reduced to hold heat. Check the listing for the skirt and pole details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating and seams",
    "explanation": "3000mm handles heavy rain, and taped seams keep water out of the stitching. Silicone-coated nylon sheds snow well. Look for the rating and the seam detail."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Condensation in cold",
    "explanation": "Cold nights cause breath moisture to freeze on tent walls. Vents and a gap under the fly lower it. Check for vents even in a 4 season tent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "Winter tents weigh more than 3 season models. The Stella is 4.8 lb while the GEERTOP Blackout is 7.7 lb. Pick based on how far you carry it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Snow loads and pitching",
    "explanation": "Light snow is manageable, but a heavy load needs the snow cleared. Stake out guy lines and orient the door away from wind. Do not treat budget tents as expedition shelters."

    "a": "Expecting expedition performance from a budget 4 season tent. Check poles and guy lines, and pitch with care. These tents suit mild winter use."

    "q": "Is the blackout version worth it?",
    "a": "If you sleep during the day, yes, as with the GEERTOP 2-Person Blackout. Otherwise it adds weight and cost without much benefit."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch in snow?",
    "a": "Stamp a flat platform, stake the corners and snow skirt with buried objects, and guy out the fly. Keep the door sheltered. Clear snow from the walls."
