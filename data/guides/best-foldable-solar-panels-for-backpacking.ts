  {
    "criterion": "What backpack panels can do",
    "explanation": "A 28W to 40W panel in full sun can top up a phone in a couple of hours and a small power bank over a day. It cannot run a laptop reliably. Look for the per-port output on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight versus watts",
    "explanation": "Roughly 1.5 pounds buys 28W, and more watts add ounces. Add up what you actually charge. Look for a printed weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge a bank, not a phone",
    "explanation": "Plugging a phone directly into a panel works, but clouds interrupt charging. Charging a power bank in the sun and the phone later from the bank is steadier. Check for pass-through or smart chip wording."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water rating",
    "explanation": "IP44 handles splashes, and IP67 handles heavy rain and brief dunks. A panel hanging on a pack in rain needs the higher rating. Look for the IP number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hanging and angling",
    "explanation": "Panels charge best facing the sun at about 45 degrees. A pack-mounted panel changes angle as you walk. Look for loops, carabiners or grommets."

    "q": "Is the FlexSolar worth it over the BigBlue?",
