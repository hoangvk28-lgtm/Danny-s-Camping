export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "AGM versus LiFePO4",
    "explanation": "AGM costs less up front and works with most existing chargers, while LiFePO4 weighs far less and allows deeper discharge. Lithium needs a matching charge profile. Pick by weight, budget and winter use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Usable capacity",
    "explanation": "AGM lasts longest when used to about 50 percent depth of discharge, so 100Ah delivers roughly 50Ah. LiFePO4 can usually use most of its rating. Size the bank by daily watt-hours."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Group size and tray fit",
    "explanation": "Group 24 and Group 31 differ in length and height, so measure your tray. A drop-in fit saves rewiring. Check dimensions and terminal type on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold weather and charging",
    "explanation": "Lithium charging pauses below freezing on batteries with a low-temperature function, which the Super Empower lists. AGM can charge more widely, within the listed range. Check winter use first."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BMS, fuses and wiring",
    "explanation": "A built-in BMS protects lithium cells from overcharge, over-discharge and short circuits. Fuse the positive lead near the battery and use matched cables. Never mix chemistries in one bank."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How big a battery does an RV need?",
    "a": "Add your daily watt-hours and divide by 12, then size for the depth-of-discharge limit. A lights and fan load may fit one 100Ah battery, while a fridge and inverter need more. Buy extra in parallel."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Mixing a lithium battery into an AGM bank or using the wrong charger profile. The Super Empower Group 24 LiFePO4 needs a lithium setting. Set the charger before connecting."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is lithium worth the price?",
    "a": "For weight and cycle life, yes, such as the VEMDIA 100Ah LiFePO4. AGM like the Weize 100Ah AGM is cheaper and simpler. Choose by use pattern."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I replace a house battery?",
    "a": "Disconnect the negative first, then the positive, swap the battery, and reconnect positive then negative. Fuse the positive near the battery. Check the charger profile."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I protect it in winter?",
    "a": "Keep lithium above freezing when charging, or insulate it, and top up AGM before storage. Disconnect loads. The Renogy 100Ah AGM's low-temperature range helps."
