export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Stove jack and pipe fit",
    "explanation": "A stove jack is a fire-resistant opening that lets a stovepipe exit the tent safely. Fit matters, since a 3 inch jack cannot take a 4 inch pipe. Measure your stovepipe and look for flame-retardant material around the opening, and keep a CO alarm in the tent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A 2500mm to 3000mm rating handles steady rain, while heavier snow melt and long storms favor higher figures. Ripstop fabric resists tears better than plain polyester. Look for the millimeter rating and the denier in the product title or bullet points. Seam taping matters as much as the number, so check that the stitching is sealed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor size and peak",
    "explanation": "A 6 foot peak lets most adults stand, while a 4 foot peak does not. Stove clearance also needs space, so a 13 foot floor is easier to heat safely than a 7 foot one. Compare diameter and height, not the person rating. A taller roof also keeps the stovepipe well above your head."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed weight",
    "explanation": "A tent under 10 pounds can be carried from the car to a nearby site without pain, while canvas hot tents weigh much more. Hammock campers favor long, light shells. Check the packed weight and bag dimensions. A light tent also pitches faster in cold hands."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Inner tent and ground",
    "explanation": "Many budget hot tents leave out the floor and inner mesh. Without an inner tent, bugs and drafts enter through the bottom edge. Check whether an inner tent or ground mat is included before you order. A footprint and a mesh inner often cost under thirty dollars together, so budget for both."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a stove in any hot tent?",
    "a": "Only in a tent built with a stove jack, which is a fire-resistant opening for the pipe. Use a stove with a spark arrestor, keep a safe clearance from the walls and run a battery CO alarm. Never sleep with the stove burning."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is polyester safe with a wood stove?",
    "a": "Polyester can melt from sparks, so hot tents use flame-retardant coatings and keep the stove clear of the walls. A spark arrestor on the pipe reduces embers. Canvas resists sparks better but costs more. Check the stove jack area for scorch marks after each trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the CampRavox worth more than the VEVOR tipis?",
    "a": "If you camp in storms, yes, since its 3000mm ripstop shell and steel poles are tougher. The VEVOR 4-6 Tipi gives far more floor for far less money. Choose by weather and group size. Choose by group size and weather."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do I need besides the tent?",
    "a": "A stove, pipe sections, a spark arrestor and a ground cover are extras. A CO alarm and fire extinguisher are essential. Add a snow skirt or extra stakes in wind. Match the pipe diameter to the stove jack size before buying."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stop condensation in a hot tent?",
    "a": "Vent the top and bottom, and keep the stove burning. Wipe the walls in the morning and dry the tent before packing. An inner tent such as the Naturehike Ranch Fire adds a drier layer."
