export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What compact means for a double",
    "explanation": "A double bag is large, and the best you can expect is a bag that rolls into a sack. Expect a bundle the size of a large duffel. Check whether the listing prints dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature ranges",
    "explanation": "Only one of these three prints a range. A listing with no range gives you nothing to plan against. Treat unstated bags as warm-weather only."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Splitting layout",
    "explanation": "A double that splits into two singles lets you reuse it on solo trips. Dual zippers and two-way zippers help. Check the listing for splitting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lining and bulk",
    "explanation": "Flannel feels soft but adds bulk. Pongee and polyester pack smaller. Choose by how often you move the bag."

    "a": "If you camp near 40F, yes. The ETGLCOZY XL Queen is cheaper and converts into blankets. Choose by the weather."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I split a double?",
    "a": "Unzip the shared edge, then zip each half to its own side if it splits. Test it at home. The AGEMORE Flannel Double and ETGLCOZY XL Queen list this feature."
