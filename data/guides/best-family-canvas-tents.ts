export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity under stove use",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Frame vs center pole",
    "explanation": "A steel frame supports vertical walls and snow load, while a single center pole gives open floor but sloping walls. Frame tents weigh more. Check the frame material and whether corner clearance suits cots."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Canvas weight and finish",
    "explanation": "Heavier canvas breathes and lasts longer, but needs drying. A PU rating such as 3000mm shows water resistance. Look for gsm and the mm number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor material",
    "explanation": "A PVC floor lasts, and a welded floor seam stops leaks. A zip-off floor adds summer airflow. Check thickness in oz or gsm."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Setup time and effort",

    "a": "Skipping a trial pitch. Canvas takes time and hands. Test at home before the trip."

  {
    "q": "Is canvas worth it over a nylon tent?",
    "a": "Canvas breathes and handles heat and wind better, but it is heavy and slower to pitch. These tents run 140 to 1,000 dollars. Pay for canvas if you camp from a vehicle."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch a bell tent?",
    "a": "Lay it flat, stake the perimeter and raise the center pole. Then adjust the guy ropes evenly. Two adults can do it in 25 minutes."
