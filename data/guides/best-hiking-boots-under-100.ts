export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What a hundred dollars buys",
    "explanation": "At under $100, boots usually land in one of two camps: branded waterproof systems with leather and mesh, or lightweight synthetic builds from value brands. The first camp lasts more seasons, the second keeps weight and cost down. Decide how many trips a year you take, then match the camp to that number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof construction type",
    "explanation": "A waterproof boot may use a membrane liner, seam sealing or a coated upper, and the combination matters when water pools around the ankle. Seam-sealed designs hold up longer in sustained rain than a plain treated upper. Check the listing for the words membrane or seam-sealed, not just the word waterproof in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outsole lug pattern",
    "explanation": "Lugs are the raised rubber bumps that bite into dirt and gravel. Deep, multi-directional lugs shed mud and add grip on slopes, while shallow lugs are quieter on pavement but slick on wet clay. Look for a described lug design or traction brand name before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight versus durability",
    "explanation": "Light boots such as the HARENCE Waterproof reduce leg fatigue, but thin synthetic uppers wear faster than leather. Heavier boots resist abrasion and keep their shape, which matters if you scramble over rock. Look at the weight if the listing gives one, and treat missing weights as unknown."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Toe and heel protection",
    "explanation": "A rubber toe cap shields toes from rocks and roots, and a reinforced heel keeps the foot locked in on descents. These parts add a few dollars to a boot, so budget models often skip them. Check the bullet points for the exact words toe cap and heel counter."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lacing versus zipper",
    "explanation": "Lace-up boots let you loosen the instep and tighten around the ankle, which controls heel slip. Side-zip boots speed entry but offer a single fixed fit. Look at the closure on the listing and decide how much adjustment your foot needs."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are under-$100 boots good enough for long hikes?",
    "a": "Yes for day hikes and moderate overnights, as long as the boot fits well and the sole has real lugs. Heavy loads and technical terrain reward stiffer, pricier boots. Break any boot in on shorter walks first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I trust the waterproof label?",
    "a": "Treat it as a starting point. Look for membrane or seam-sealed language, and remember that any boot can leak over the cuff when puddles run deeper than the ankle collar."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are Columbia boots worth the extra over NORTIV 8?",
    "a": "The Columbia pair name their waterproof and traction systems and use leather, which suits frequent hikers. NORTIV 8 saves money and works well for casual use."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I size a hiking boot online?",
    "a": "Order your usual size, leave a thumb's width in front of the toes and wear your hiking socks when trying them. Check the return window and walk downstairs to see if toes hit the front."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I make cheap boots last?",
    "a": "Clean mud off after outings, dry them away from heat and replace the insole when it flattens. Treat leather with a conditioner and keep suede brushed."
