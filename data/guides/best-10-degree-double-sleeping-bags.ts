It has a poly-flannel lining, shoulder and zipper draft tubes, and unzips on both sides and across the bottom.\n\nNext to the Guide Gear Canvas Hunter, it swaps a heavy canvas shell for a lighter fiber-fill build with a stuff sack, so it is far easier to move from car to campsite. The extra length also suits a taller partner better than the WKFAMOUT's 86.7 inch cut.\n\nA solid choice for couples who camp when nights fall below freezing and want one roomy bag.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rating gap on doubles",
    "explanation": "A double bag labeled 0 degree is usually a limit figure, and two people add warmth, so comfort tends to run warmer. Read the label as survival range, not cozy range. If the listing prints a comfort number, trust it before the label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Width for two adults",
    "explanation": "Shoulder width decides whether two adults fit without squeezing out the insulation. Fifty inches suits a snug couple, while 59 to 62 inches gives real room. Check the width in the listing, not only the word queen."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Insulation weight",
    "explanation": "Fill measured in pounds is a rough guide to warmth on doubles. Seven pounds of insulation will run warmer than five. Compare the number printed on the listing, and prefer bags that state it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell fabric",
    "explanation": "Canvas resists snags and sparks but weighs more and dries slowly. Polyester is lighter and packs smaller. Choose the shell that matches how and where you camp."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and portability",
    "explanation": "Doubles run from about 10 to 14 lb, which limits them to car camping. The weight printed on the listing tells you whether you can carry it at all. If no weight appears, assume it is heavy."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 0 degree double enough for 10 degree nights?",
    "a": "Usually yes with a sleeping pad and base layers, because two bodies add warmth. Comfort figures still run warmer than the label, so treat 10F as the cold edge. Add a wool hat and a closed-cell pad."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do couples make with doubles?",
    "a": "They buy a bag that is too narrow and compress the insulation at the shoulders. Check the stated width, and prefer 59 inches or more. A snug bag loses warmth where bodies press the fill flat."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a double worth it over two singles?",
    "a": "A double saves money and shares warmth, but a single bag usually seals better around each sleeper. The WKFAMOUT splits into two singles, which gives you both options. A zip-together pair of singles costs more."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a double bag in a tent?",
    "a": "Lay out a pad wide enough for two, or two pads strapped together. Then spread the bag over them and zip the sides closed. Check that the tent floor is wide enough for the bag's full width."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I clean a canvas or flannel double?",
    "a": "Spot clean when you can, and wash gently with mild detergent only as the label allows. Dry completely before storing, because damp cotton mildews. Hang it loose after trips."
