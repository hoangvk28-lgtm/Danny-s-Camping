export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Read the capacity claim",
    "explanation": "A 5-person beach tent often means five seated people with no gear. Compare the interior width in inches with the number of chairs or mats you plan to bring. Under 60 inches wide is tight for five."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the UPF rating",
    "explanation": "UPF 50+ is a standard sun-protection rating, and a silver coating helps reflect heat. A tent that only says UV protection gives no number to judge. Look for the rating in the feature list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plan for wind and sand",
    "explanation": "Sandbag pockets or stakes are needed in breeze. A light pop-up shelter can lift easily. Look for anchor points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider privacy",
    "explanation": "A zipper door and window turn a shade into a changing room. Mesh windows ventilate. Check the listing."

    "a": "Ignoring wind. Light shelters can lift on a breezy beach. Fill the sandbags and stake the corners."

  {
    "q": "Is the larger tent worth it?",
    "a": "Yes for five or six. It lists more width and a stronger water rating. For four people the cheaper tent works."
  },

    "q": "How do I set it up?",
    "a": "Release the spring or open the frame, stake or fill the sandbags and open the doors. Face the door away from wind. It takes seconds."
