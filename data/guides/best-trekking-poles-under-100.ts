export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon versus aluminum",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flip locks beat twist locks",
    "explanation": "Flip locks clamp the sections and are easier to adjust with gloves. The listings here call them more secure than twist locks. Look for metal flip locks, not plastic."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Folding size matters for travel",
    "explanation": "Folding poles pack to 15 inches, while two-section collapsing poles are longer. The aluminum Hiker Hunger Foldable and Trek-Z both fold to 15 inches. Check the folded length against your pack."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Grip material",
    "explanation": "Cork absorbs sweat and conforms to the hand, while foam is lighter and warmer. The Hiker Hunger Carbon adds a foam extension below the cork. Look at the grip and extension on the listing."

    "criterion": "Height range",
    "explanation": "Poles should let your elbow rest at about 90 degrees on flat ground. The Hiker Hunger Foldable sells two ranges, 100 to 120 cm and 115 to 135 cm. Choose by height."
