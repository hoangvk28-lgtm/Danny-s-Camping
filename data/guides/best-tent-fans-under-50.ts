export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Oscillation and tilt",
    "explanation": "Oscillation sweeps the fan left to right, covering more of a tent than a fixed fan. A 270 degree tilt aims airflow up or down. Look for oscillation angles in the specs, since ceiling fans usually have none. Wider sweeps lose some airflow at the edges, so aim the fan to cover the sleeping area."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity",
    "explanation": "A 20000mAh battery runs a fan for days on low, while a 10000mAh unit lasts about a day. Bigger batteries also charge slower and weigh more. Check the mAh and charging time in the specs. Check whether fast charging needs a compatible charger, since a standard USB plug can double the charge time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Quiet motor",
    "explanation": "A brushless DC motor under 30 decibels is about as loud as a whisper, which matters when the fan is near your ear. Cheaper motors hum or click. Look for brushless motor or a decibel figure in the title. If noise matters, read how the maker describes low-speed operation, since a quiet fan on high can still be loud."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dimmable light",
    "explanation": "A dimmable light with several color temperatures can serve as a reading lamp or a night light. A basic three-step light is fine for finding your boots. Look for stepless dimming and Kelvin numbers if you read in the tent. Warm 3000K light is easier on the eyes at night, and cool 6000K light helps when you cook or sort gear."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather resistance",
    "explanation": "Many tent fans are not waterproof and are meant for covered spaces. A gazebo fan may have weather-resistant construction. Keep charging ports dry and store the fan indoors in rain. A fan that is not waterproof should still go indoors or into a dry bag if rain threatens."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is an oscillating fan better than a ceiling fan?",
    "a": "In a large tent, yes, because oscillation spreads air across the whole space. A ceiling fan covers a smaller area but frees the floor. The OGERY 20000mAh Fan oscillates at four angles. A ceiling fan also keeps its weight off the floor and away from kids and pets."
  },
  {
    "q": "How loud are battery tent fans?",
    "a": "Good brushless motors run near 30 decibels, about the level of a whisper, while cheaper motors hum. The ASZEKOK 17-Inch Fan lists under 30 decibels, which suits light sleepers. Keep the fan on low during sleep, since lower speeds run much quieter."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long do 20000mAh batteries last?",
    "a": "It depends on speed. The OGERY 20000mAh Fan lists up to 200 hours on the lowest speed and 17 hours on the highest. The Lumtide Canopy Fan also has a 20000mAh battery. Real runtimes are shorter with the light on, so use the timer to save charge."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a clip-on fan in a tent?",
    "a": "Yes, if you clamp it to a cot frame, chair or table. The Koonie 8-Inch Clip Fan has a 3 inch clamp and a head that rotates 360 degrees. It cools a person better than a room."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are these fans waterproof?",
    "a": "Mostly not. The Lumtide Canopy Fan is not waterproof and needs a covered space, while the ASZEKOK 17-Inch Fan is weather-resistant. Keep charging ports dry and store fans indoors in rain. Treat all of them as fair-weather gear."
