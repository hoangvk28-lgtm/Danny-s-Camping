export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity",
    "explanation": "Capacity in mAh tells you how many phone charges you get, and 20,000 to 50,000 mAh covers several phones. Listed numbers are best-case, so expect fewer full charges in real use. Check the mAh figure and plan on about two-thirds of it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging speed",
    "explanation": "A 22.5W output charges a phone faster than 15W, provided your phone supports the same PD or QC fast charging standard. Slow charging is fine overnight but frustrating on a short break. Check the wattage and the standards named in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-in cables",
    "explanation": "Built-in cables mean you never forget a cord, but a damaged one is hard to replace. Cable types vary between Lightning, USB-C and Micro. Check which cables are built in against what you actually use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "What the solar panel really does",
    "explanation": "The small panel adds only a trickle of power, so refilling a big bank in the sun can take many days. Treat it as an emergency top-up rather than a main charger. Charge the bank from a wall or car before you leave."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather protection",
    "explanation": "An IP65 rating means the case resists dust and water jets, which helps in rain and sand. Without a rating, keep the bank in a dry bag. Check the listing for a stated IP rating."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a solar power bank really charge from the sun?",
    "a": "Yes, but very slowly, because the built-in panel is small. It is best for a small emergency top-up. Charge it fully from a wall adapter before every trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "How many phone charges does 49800mAh give?",
    "a": "A typical phone battery is around 4000 to 5000 mAh, so a large bank can give several charges. Real-world output is lower than the label. Plan on about three to six full charges."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is fast charging important on a camping trip?",
    "a": "It helps for short breaks, such as a lunch stop or a few minutes before a hike. Your phone must support the same fast charging standard to benefit. BLASOUL 49800mAh lists 22.5W with PD and QC."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I recharge a solar power bank?",
    "a": "Use a wall or car USB adapter, since that is far faster than the solar panel. Leave it plugged in until the indicator shows full. Use the panel only if no other option is available."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I bring a solar power bank on a plane?",
    "a": "Airlines limit lithium battery capacity in carry-on bags, often to around 100Wh. Very large banks may exceed that. Check the airline rules and the rating printed on the bank."
