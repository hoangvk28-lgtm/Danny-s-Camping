  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual-purpose versus deep cycle",
    "explanation": "Dual-purpose batteries can start an engine and run a few loads, but they tolerate fewer deep discharges. Pure deep cycle models like the Weize 100Ah AGM handle repeated discharge. Check which label the listing uses."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging profile",
    "explanation": "AGM wants a controlled charge, often about 14.4V. Overcharging dries the mat and shortens life, and an incorrect charger can damage it. Use a charger or controller set for AGM."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Series, parallel and fusing",
    "explanation": "Connect batteries of the same make, size and age. Put a fuse near each positive terminal and use cables sized for the current. Never mix chemistries."

  {
    "q": "Is AGM worth it over lithium?",
    "a": "AGM costs less up front and tolerates a lot, but weighs more and gives less usable capacity. For occasional use the Weize 100Ah AGM is fine. Heavy daily cycling favors lithium."
