export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Charge controller necessity",
    "explanation": "Connecting a panel straight to a 12V battery with no controller risks overcharging it. A controller with overcharge and over-discharge protection stops that. Look for a named controller and its amp rating, not just a panel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel wattage versus battery size",
    "explanation": "A 20W panel in good sun gives roughly 1 to 1.5 amps, which tops up but does not refill. A 100Ah battery needs far more to recharge from empty. Match panel size to battery size, or use it purely for maintenance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry compatibility",
    "explanation": "Lead acid, AGM, gel and LiFePO4 each want a different charge profile. A controller that names your type is a safer fit. If the listing does not name it, ask the maker."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB versus 12V output",
    "explanation": "A USB panel charges power banks and phones at 5V and cannot charge a 12V battery. A 12V kit uses a controller and clips or ring terminals. Pick by what you actually charge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature and placement",
    "explanation": "Lithium batteries should not charge below freezing, and a hot dashboard can bake the panel and battery. Place the panel in sun and the battery in shade. Check the battery manual for a charging temperature range."

    "q": "Can I charge a car battery with these?",
    "a": "The Hoysicy 12V Panel Kit and SOLPERK 20W Panel Kit are meant to maintain 12V batteries, not jump-start them. They keep a stored battery topped up. A deeply drained battery needs a wall charger."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Skipping the controller and clipping a panel straight to a battery. That risks overcharge. Use a kit with a controller, and connect the battery first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger panel worth it for batteries?",
    "a": "For maintenance, 20W is enough. For real recharging, you need 100W or more. See the charge controller kits for larger options."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a kit?",
    "a": "Connect the controller to the battery, then to the panel, and read the indicator. Place the panel in the sun and the battery in shade. Check polarity before clipping."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain the panel?",
    "a": "Wipe the glass with a soft damp cloth and check the cable for cracks. Keep the connectors dry. Re-aim it every season."
