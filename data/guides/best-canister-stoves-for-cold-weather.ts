It is lighter and simpler than the Polaris Optifuel.\n\nIt suits winter hikers and climbers who cook in freezing conditions. Wide pot supports make snow melting steadier.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Regulator or inverted feed",
    "explanation": "Regulators hold gas pressure steady as the canister cools, and inverted feed sends liquid fuel to the burner. Both reduce the usual cold-weather sputter. Look for the word regulator or the ability to flip the canister."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel blend",
    "explanation": "Canisters with a higher propane share vaporize better in cold. The MSR IsoPro listing describes an 80/20 isobutane and propane blend. Check the blend printed on the canister."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind resistance",
    "explanation": "Wind steals heat from the flame and the pot. A concave burner or a windscreen helps. Check whether a screen is included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight",
    "explanation": "A 6 oz stove is easy to carry, and a multifuel stove with a pump is heavier. Decide how much capability you need. Add the fuel weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pot support",
    "explanation": "Snow melting uses bigger pots. A wide support holds them steady. Check the listed pot width."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Why do canister stoves struggle in cold?",
    "a": "As the fuel cools, its pressure drops and the flame weakens. Regulators and inverted feed counter this, while warming the canister helps."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which canister fuel is best in cold?",
    "a": "Blends with more propane vaporize better. The MSR IsoPro listing describes an 80/20 isobutane and propane blend as better in colder temperatures."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the SOTO Fusion Trek as good as the Vega in cold?",
    "a": "It holds steady output with a regulator, but it has no inverted feed. For deep cold the Optimus Vega is the safer choice."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I light a stove in the cold?",
    "a": "Keep the canister warm in a jacket and shield the burner from wind. Use a lighter if the igniter fails. Never use the stove inside a tent."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store canisters?",
    "a": "Keep them dry and upright at room temperature. Remove them from the stove after use and cap them."
