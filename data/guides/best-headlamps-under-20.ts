export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Lumens vs reach",
    "explanation": "A lumen number measures total light, while reach in meters shows how far a beam travels. A 650 lumen lamp with a 126 m beam suits trails, while a 230-degree flood lamp suits chores. Look for the reach number next to the lumens and take any claim above 600 lumens as a short burst rather than a running mode."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime by mode",
    "explanation": "A headlamp may claim 30 hours, but only on its lowest setting. The Everbeam lists 6.5 hours on white and 2.5 on high. Compare runtime on the mode you will actually use and remember that cold weather shortens the number a little and aim for at least two hours on a mid setting for a night of chores."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rechargeable vs AAA",
    "explanation": "A rechargeable lamp needs an outlet or a power bank, while an AAA lamp can be reloaded anywhere. A dual-power model does both. Check whether the battery is built in, and a built-in cell cannot be swapped when it wears out and a power bank solves the outlet problem in a tent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Red light",
    "explanation": "Red light preserves night vision and does not attract insects as much as white. It is handy at a shared campsite. Look for a red mode in the description, and a lamp with red and white modes saves buying a second lamp because bright white light ruins night vision for your whole group."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Motion sensor",
    "explanation": "A wave sensor lets you turn the lamp on or off without touching it, which helps with dirty hands. It can trigger by accident in a pack. Check whether you can turn the sensor off and see if the manual describes a lock-out so it stays off in a pack since a sensor that turns on in a bag drains the battery."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water rating",
    "explanation": "IPX4 resists splashes from any direction, which covers rain. An unrated lamp can fail in a downpour. Look for the IP number in the product details and treat an unrated lamp as splash-proof at best so check before a wet-weather trip, and carry a small dry bag for the lamp if rain is forecast."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need 1000 lumens in a headlamp?",
    "a": "Rarely. 200 to 400 lumens covers camp chores and trails, and the ABUSVEX 2-Pack at up to 1000 lumens drains its small battery fast. Choose a lamp with a good low mode and check that the low mode is bright enough to read by."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does IPX4 mean?",
    "a": "IPX4 means it resists splashes from any direction, which suits rain. The Everbeam H6 Pro and VAVOFO 500 Lumen carry it. It does not allow dunking, so it is fine in rain and dangerous only in a dunk."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a motion sensor useful?",
    "a": "Yes if your hands are busy, and no if the sensor trips in your pack. The Everbeam H6 Pro and Lepro Dual Power both have one. Turn it off for storage and decide whether touching the lamp with a muddy glove is a bigger problem."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I extend runtime?",
    "a": "Use a lower mode and keep the lamp warm in cold weather. The Lepro Dual Power gives 30 hours on low flood. Carry a power bank for the rechargeable lamps and keep the lamp out of a freezing pocket overnight."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are two-packs worth it?",
    "a": "Yes for couples, as the Energizer Vision HD+ 2-Pack and ABUSVEX 2-Pack cost less per lamp. One lamp can stay as a spare. Check the lamps use the same charger, and share a spare charging cable between them."
