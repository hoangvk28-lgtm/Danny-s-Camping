export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Air tent or pole tent",
    "explanation": "Inflatable beams replace poles and let you pitch in 8 to 15 minutes, but a hand pump is real work and a puncture needs a repair kit. Pole tents are lighter and simpler to fix. Check pump type and repair details. Look for a repair kit and a note about valve type in the product details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Group size",
    "explanation": "A 74 square foot floor holds 4 to 6 on air mattresses, while a 14 by 10.5 foot floor fits 8 to 10. Bells give standing room around the center. Compare dimensions to your sleepers. Allow about 15 square feet for each adult with gear."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stove jack position",
    "explanation": "A top jack suits a center stove, while a side jack suits a corner stove. Confirm jack size against your pipe. Keep a 3 foot clearance and a CO alarm. Check jack position and whether it comes pre-cut or uncut, because that decides how easily your pipe fits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell fabric",
    "explanation": "Oxford 600D is sturdy, 70D ripstop resists tears, and 210T polyester is light. A PU3000 coating handles rain. Look for denier and a millimeter rating. Higher denier means heavier fabric but better resistance to abrasion and sparks, so look for denier and the millimeter rating in the product details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed weight to carry",
    "explanation": "Air tents and canvas bells are heavy for their size, while tipis are light. Plan on a vehicle drop-off for the big ones. Check the packed weight and bag size. Look for the packed weight and bag size in the product details before you order."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a stove in an inflatable tent?",
    "a": "Only if the tent is built with a stove jack and the manufacturer allows it. Even then, keep clearance and a CO alarm. The QIFA 74 sq ft Air Tent includes one, but check that the jack material is flame retardant before lighting anything."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does an air tent last?",
    "a": "Air beams last as long as the seams hold, which is several seasons with care. Carry a patch kit. Avoid sharp stakes near the beams. Store the tent dry and deflated loosely, and avoid dragging it across rough ground."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Oxford bell worth it over a tipi?",
    "a": "Yes if you need a floor of 16 feet. The Naturehike Ranch Fire is better for a small group and has an inner tent. Choose by group size. The bell also gives you standing height around the center pole, which tipis only match near the apex."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I weigh stove safety in a polyester tent?",
    "a": "Use a stove with a spark arrestor and keep a 3 foot clearance. Never leave the stove burning while asleep. Check the jack sleeve for scorch marks after each trip and replace it if it looks thin."
  },
  {
    "q": "What accessories do I need?",
    "a": "A stove, pipe sections, a spark arrestor, a ground cover and a CO alarm are the main extras. Add a repair kit for air tents. Buy pipe to match the jack. Buy pipe sections that match the jack diameter so the fit is snug."
