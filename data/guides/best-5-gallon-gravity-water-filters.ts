Water poured into the upper chamber passes through a 4-stage chain: net pre-filter, sleeve pre-filter, Nano pre-filter and a multi-media cartridge.

Every stage is replaceable, and the version listed here bundles an extra filter set.\n\nA solid fit for RV bases, hunting camps and cabins where power cuts or boil advisories are a real possibility.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "True reservoir volume",
    "explanation": "Gravity systems have an upper chamber that you fill by pouring, so its size sets how much water you get per refill. A 5 gallon bucket and a 6 gallon countertop unit are close in size but not identical. Check the number in the product title and the shape of the reservoir."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Filter life per set",
    "explanation": "The filter element wears out after a stated volume of water. The Crown Berkey lists up to 6,000 gallons per pair, while the OutbackWater lists daily output rather than lifetime. Work out your monthly gallons to see how often you will replace."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Contaminant claims",
    "explanation": "Gravity filters are described differently on every listing, from 200 contaminants tested to bacteria and sediment. Only count what a listing explicitly names. If viruses or chemicals matter, look for a stated standard or add a treatment step."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Source water",
    "explanation": "Some systems target tap water, others lake and rain water. The OutbackWater lists lakes, rivers, streams and stored rain, which means heavy sediment. Use a clean pre-filter or net when you feed it surface water."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stable setup",
    "explanation": "A gravity unit needs a level, stable surface and a place to catch filtered water. A countertop or table works, and a spigot sets how you fill. Make sure your rig has the counter space before you buy."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a gravity filter safe for lake water?",
    "a": "The OutbackWater listing says it filters water from lakes, rivers and streams. The listing does not name a virus or standards claim, so add a treatment step if you are unsure of the source. Always pre-filter visible sediment first."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with gravity filters?",
    "a": "They put the unit on an uneven surface or let filtered water sit open. Level the base and keep a clean lidded container under the spigot."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Crown Berkey worth it over a bucket system?",
    "a": "If you will use it daily for months, yes. The long element life and stainless body pay back over time. For a few trips a year, a bucket system costs less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I prime a gravity filter?",
    "a": "Elements usually need a priming step before first use, so follow the maker's instructions. Fill the upper chamber slowly and wait for steady flow. Discard the first batch if directed."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain a gravity filter?",
    "a": "Rinse the upper chamber and clean the pre-filters regularly. Replace elements by volume or when flow drops. Store the unit dry and covered between trips."
