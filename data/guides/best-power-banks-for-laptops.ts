  "A power bank for a laptop needs far more than phone-class output: 65W to 165W on USB-C, or an AC outlet that can power a standard laptop brick. Capacity in watt-hours decides how many hours of work you get, so the numbers matter more than the mAh headline.",
  "Five banks made the shortlist, from a 165W aluminum USB-C pack to two 27000mAh banks with a 100W AC outlet and a mini power station. They were compared on output, capacity, cable design, airline notes and ports."

  {
    "criterion": "USB-C versus AC outlet",
    "explanation": "Most modern laptops charge over USB-C, but older models and some gaming laptops need an AC brick. An AC bank can run either through its outlet or a USB-C port. Check your laptop's charger rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours decide runtime",
    "explanation": "A 20,000mAh bank is about 74Wh and a 27000mAh bank about 98Wh. A laptop that draws 40W runs about 1.5 hours per 60Wh. Do the math with your laptop's actual draw."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Total versus single-port output",
    "explanation": "A 165W total means the sum of all ports, and one port may offer 100W at most. Charging a laptop and a phone together splits that. Look for both numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Airline limits",
    "explanation": "Banks under 100Wh can fly in the cabin. The 99.9Wh and 98Wh models sit right under that cap. Check the Wh on the listing before a trip."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Conversion losses on AC",

    "a": "If your laptop needs a brick or you want a small appliance, yes. The Paopaoyu 27000mAh AC Bank has a 100W outlet. For modern laptops, USB-C is more efficient."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a laptop with a bank?",
