export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Bottle volume",
    "explanation": "A squeeze bottle holds between half a liter and a liter, and you refill from the source often. On dry stretches, volume matters more than weight. Check the capacity and carry a second bottle for dry camps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Micron rating",
    "explanation": "A 0.1 micron membrane blocks bacteria and protozoa, and a 0.2 micron membrane is coarser. Bacteria are generally larger than both, but tighter is more precise. Look for the rating and any lab-condition qualifier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flow and squeeze effort",
    "explanation": "A listed flow of 2 liters per minute is fast, and 1 liter per minute is workable. Real flow depends on water clarity and filter age. Look for the printed flow and plan to clean the filter when flow slows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cleaning without tools",
    "explanation": "Shake or rinse cleaning avoids carrying a syringe on the trail. The JEYOGO and Katadyn bottles both describe shake cleaning. Check the cleaning method before you buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Freeze and drop damage",
    "explanation": "Hollow fibers can crack if the filter freezes or is dropped hard, and the damage is invisible. A filter integrity check lets you test it, and otherwise you replace a suspect filter. Look for the check on the listing."

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I put drink mix in a filter bottle?",
