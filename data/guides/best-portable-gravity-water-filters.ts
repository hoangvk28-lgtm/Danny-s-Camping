The listing says it flows at 1.75 liters per minute with no pumping and removes bacteria at 99.9999% and protozoa at 99.9%, along with dirt.\n\nIt holds far more than the Waterdrop set, and a film reservoir with a sediment trap keeps grit out of the filter. A hang strap and bag clip make it easy to hang, and the storage bag has a PFAS-free water-repellent finish.\n\nBest for groups of four or more that share a basecamp. One person can fill it while the rest set up.",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flow rate",
    "explanation": "1.75 L/min means 10 liters in under six minutes, while 700 ml/min takes about fourteen. Flow drops as the filter clogs. Check the printed rates and plan to backflush."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pore size and claims",
    "explanation": "A 0.1 micron membrane targets bacteria and protozoa, not viruses. The MSR AutoFlow XL lists bacteria and protozoa numbers. Neither listing claims viruses, so treat if needed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hanging hardware",
    "explanation": "Gravity needs height, so a strap or hook matters. A strap that cannot reach a branch leaves the bag on a rock. Look for hanging hardware by name."
