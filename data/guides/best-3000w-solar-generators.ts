export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "3000W is usually surge",
    "explanation": "A 3000W figure on a portable station is usually a brief peak for starting motors. Continuous output is what keeps a heater or microwave running. Check which number sits next to the word rated or continuous."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours behind the watts",
    "explanation": "A 2,083Wh battery runs a 2,000W load for about an hour. Divide watt-hours by load watts. Choose capacity by how long the big load will run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Air conditioners and compressors",
    "explanation": "An RV air conditioner can need two to three times its running watts to start. Check the unit's start watts against the surge rating. Use a soft starter if the unit trips."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging speed",
    "explanation": "Fast AC charging refills a unit between trips, while solar input handles off-grid days. Compare 0 to 80 percent times and solar watts. Skip units whose listing shows only a full-charge time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry and cycles",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells list thousands of cycles. A stated figure, such as over 4,000, shows lifespan. Look for cell type in the title or specs."

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Possibly, depending on the unit's start watts and the station's surge. Check both numbers and ask the maker."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger unit worth it?",
    "a": "For long outages, yes, because more watt-hours means more hours of power. For weekend trips, the smaller EcoFlow DELTA 3 Classic is fine."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect the panel?",
    "a": "Plug it into the solar input with the correct cable. Stay within the listed voltage limit, and angle the panel toward the sun."

    "q": "How do I look after it?",
    "a": "Store it at partial charge in a cool dry place. Recharge it every few months so the cells stay healthy."
