  {
    "criterion": "Format and group size",
    "explanation": "A solo hiker is well served by a squeeze bottle or straw, while four people sharing a pot need a pump or gravity set. The wrong format makes water chores take all evening. Count how many liters you need per night."

  {
    "criterion": "Lifespan and cartridge cost",
    "explanation": "Lifespan ranges from 65 gallons for a GRAYL cartridge to 5,300 liters for a Waterdrop straw. A cheap filter that wears out quickly costs more per liter. Compare the stated lifespan and the cost of a replacement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flow and silty water",
    "explanation": "Flow rates on the box are for clear water. Silty streams slow every filter and clog pores, which is why a pre-filter or pump helps. Look for a stated pre-filter and a cleaning method."
