export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 90W really delivers",
    "explanation": "A 90W port suits most thin-and-light laptops but is more than a phone needs. A laptop negotiates the voltage it accepts, so a 65W laptop will draw less. Check your laptop charger's printed wattage and pick a bank that meets or exceeds it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shared versus single-port power",
    "explanation": "The 90W headline usually applies when one port is used. Add a phone on a second port and the total is divided between them. Look for a total output line in the listing, not only the headline figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "20000mAh versus laptop runtime",
    "explanation": "A 20000mAh bank is about 74Wh, which is roughly one full charge for a 14 inch laptop. Heavy tasks drain the laptop quickly, so plan on one charge rather than several. Use the listing's charges-per-laptop figure as a guide."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable type and rating",
    "explanation": "A cheap cable can limit a 90W bank to a lower wattage. Look for a USB-C cable rated for 100W, and confirm that any bundled cable is named in the title or bullets. A detachable cable is easier to replace than an attached one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Self-charging time",
    "explanation": "Recharge input ranges from 1.8 hours to longer on the listings here. If you only have a short charge window before a trip, the fastest input matters more than the last 10 percent of capacity. Look for the self-charging figure in the bullet list."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Will a 90W bank charge my laptop?",
    "a": "Many USB-C laptops accept up to 90W, but a larger gaming laptop may need more. Check your laptop's charger rating before buying. Charging may be slower if the laptop draws more than the bank supplies."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a special cable?",
    "a": "Use a USB-C cable rated for 100W with a 90W bank. A basic phone cable limits the speed. Some listings include a cable and some do not."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 90W worth it over 65W?",
    "a": "Yes if you own a laptop that benefits from the extra headroom or want to charge two devices. A 65W bank is enough for thin laptops. The 90W units here also keep 65W recharge speed."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I recharge it quickly?",
    "a": "Use a 65W or higher wall charger on the bank's USB-C input. Charging through a weak port takes much longer. Plug it in the night before you leave."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use it on a plane?",
    "a": "A 20000mAh bank is about 74Wh, which is under the common 100Wh carry-on limit. Pack it in your hand luggage, never in checked bags. Check your airline rules for any change."
