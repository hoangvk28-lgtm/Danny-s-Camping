export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Panel wattage",
    "explanation": "A solar panel's wattage is how much power it can make in full sun. A 30W panel recharges a large battery much faster than a 7W panel, which can need many hours. Look for the wattage and not just the word solar."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery size and runtime",
    "explanation": "Capacity in mAh sets how long the fan runs, and the listed runtime almost always assumes the lowest speed. A 20000mAh fan carries more than a 10400mAh one on a cloudy day. Check for runtime at the speed you will use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Split or fixed panel",
    "explanation": "A fixed panel on the fan heats the fan in the sun, and the fan has to sit outside to charge. A split panel on a cable can sit in the sun while the fan stays in the tent. Look for a cable length on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water resistance",
    "explanation": "Some solar fans are not waterproof and need to be taken in during rain. Camping weather changes fast, so this matters. Look for a clear note on waterproofing or sheltered use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging by other means",
    "explanation": "Solar alone is not dependable on a gray weekend. A USB or Type-C port lets you top the battery from a car or power bank. Check that the fan lists a charging port."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lantern and light modes",
    "explanation": "A fan with a lantern in the same body shares one battery with the light. Dimmable light saves charge. Look for the number of brightness levels."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much sun does a solar tent fan need?",
    "a": "It depends on the panel. A 30W panel like the Lumtide's refills faster than 7W panels like the JINLICTE's, which can need a full day of direct sun. Cloudy days stretch charging further."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a solar fan run directly from the panel?",
    "a": "Some can, but most are meant to charge the battery and run from it. Direct sun gives uneven power. Charge by day and run at night."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a solar fan worth it over a USB one?",
    "a": "Only if you camp off-grid for several days. A USB fan with a power bank is lighter and more dependable for one night. A solar fan adds the ability to recharge without a car."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a split solar fan?",
    "a": "Place the panel in open sun, face it south in the northern hemisphere and run the cable to the tent. Keep the cable off paths and the connector dry. Tilt the panel through the day."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for a solar fan between trips?",
    "a": "Wipe the panel, charge the battery to about half and store it indoors. The Lumtide lists that it is not waterproof, so it should never be left out in rain. Check the port for dust before the next trip."
