export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Room beats weight",
    "explanation": "Without a pack to carry, spend on size. Both picks are wide enough to roll over in. The TETON Celsius XXL is cut extra long and the BORULL measures 92 by 63 inches. Check the listing for the stated maximum height."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Single or double",
    "explanation": "A double saves space in the car and shares heat, but it only works with a partner who sleeps at similar temperatures. A single lets each sleeper pick a rating. Decide before you shop, because a bag for two is awkward for one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Read the temperature figure",
    "explanation": "Comfort is the number to trust. The BORULL prints a comfort range of 40 to 65F and a 30F limit. The TETON Celsius XXL lists a 0 degree rating, which is a limit-style number, so expect comfort at higher temperatures."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lining and fill",
    "explanation": "Flannel and plush linings feel warm to the touch but dry slowly when damp. Fiber fill such as SuperLoft Elite keeps loft in damp air. Check the listing for lining and fill names."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pillows and extras",
    "explanation": "Included pillows, hoods and draft tubes save money on small items. They also make a bag feel more like a bed. Look for them in the first feature bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pair it with a pad",
    "explanation": "A bag is only half of a sleep system, and the ground draws heat from underneath. Use a thick pad rated for the season. A foam mattress is a better answer to hard ground than a heavier bag."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do car campers need a special sleeping bag?",
    "a": "Not special, but a roomy one. Without a weight limit you can choose a larger cut like the XXL and add pillows or a pad."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do car campers make most?",
    "a": "They buy a bag for the temperature and forget the pad. Cold ground steals more heat than cold air, so add a thick pad."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the TETON Celsius XXL worth it over the BORULL Double Queen?",
    "a": "For solo cold-weather use, yes, because it lists a colder rating. For a couple in mild weather the BORULL gives more room and a shared bed."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I fit a big bag in the car?",
    "a": "Use the included stuff sack and straps to compress it. Store it loose in a large bag at home to protect the fill."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I wash these bags?",
    "a": "Check the care label on the bag you receive. Most synthetic bags go in a front-loading machine on a gentle cycle, and they should dry fully before storage."
