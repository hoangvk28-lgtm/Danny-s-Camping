export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort versus lower limit",
    "explanation": "A 50F comfort rating is where an average sleeper stays warm, while a 32F lower limit is where they survive curled up. The gap between the two is wide, and it is where cold nights hide. Look for both figures on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power",
    "explanation": "Fill power measures how much space an ounce of down fills, and higher numbers loft better. A 650 figure is a mid-range down that still packs small. Check the listing for a number, because a vague claim of premium down tells you nothing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Down versus down blanket",
    "explanation": "A closed bag traps heat around your whole body. A blanket leaves gaps at the sides and the neck. Use a blanket as a supplement or a hammock layer, not as your main bag in cold air."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Moisture and shell",
    "explanation": "Down loses loft when wet, so a water-repellent shell helps in dew and light mist. Check the listing for DWR or similar treatment. Keep the bag in a dry sack on the trail."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pack size and zipper",
    "explanation": "Down compresses small, and a zip-together layout adds flexibility for couples. Check the packed dimensions and zipper types. A second zipper at the foot gives airflow on warm nights."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 50F down bag enough for summer?",
    "a": "Yes for most summer nights above 50F. Below that, add a liner or pick a warmer bag. The ZOOOBELIVES Ultralight Down lists a 32F lower limit."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with down blankets?",
    "a": "They treat a blanket like a bag. A blanket leaves gaps and offers no rating. Use the ROSE FEATHER Down Blanket as a supplement."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is real down worth it for 50F?",
    "a": "Down packs smaller and weighs less. If you carry the bag, yes. For car camping, a synthetic bag costs less and handles damp better."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up the ZOOOBELIVES at camp?",
    "a": "Shake it out so the fill lofts, then lay it on a pad. Use the footbox zipper to vent. Keep it off damp ground."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a down bag?",
    "a": "Keep it loose in a large breathable sack, not compressed. Wash only as the tag directs. Dry it completely before storing."
