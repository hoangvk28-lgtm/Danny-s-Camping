export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 220V and 240V mean",
    "explanation": "In North America, 220V loads actually run on 240V split-phase, two 120V legs combined. A dryer, an electric range, a well pump and a large air conditioner use it. Check the listing for the words 120V/240V or split phase, not just a big wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated watts for 240V loads",
    "explanation": "A 240V appliance still draws watts, so total output must exceed the load. A 5,000W well pump needs a station rated beyond that, plus surge. Look at the continuous AC figure and the surge figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and runtime",
    "explanation": "A 3,600Wh battery runs a 3,000W load for roughly an hour. Divide stored watt-hours by load watts. A 240V circuit for a well pump usually runs in short cycles."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch and wiring",
    "explanation": "Feeding a house panel needs an approved transfer switch and often a licensed electrician. Never backfeed through a standard outlet. Look for a named transfer switch accessory on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input and panel kit",
    "explanation": "Maximum solar input in watts sets the fastest refill. A kit with three 400W panels gives more daily energy than a single 100W panel. Match the panel voltage range to the station's input."

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a 240V dryer into the station?",
    "a": "Only with the right outlet type and a matching adapter or transfer inlet. Ask the maker about the correct connection and have an electrician check the wiring."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 240V solar generator worth it over a 120V one?",
    "a": "Only if you own a 240V appliance. Otherwise a 120V kit like the BLUETTI Elite 200 V2 is lighter and cheaper."
