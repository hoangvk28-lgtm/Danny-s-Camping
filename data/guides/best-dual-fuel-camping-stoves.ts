    "explanation": "BTU is the heat a burner can put out, and a higher number boils water faster. A 7,800 BTU stove is plenty for a coffee. A 15,000 BTU stove suits large pots. Use the number as a comparison within the same type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel connection",
    "explanation": "A dual fuel stove connects to propane with an adapter or hose. Check that the adapter is in the box. The Gospowor includes a 1.6 foot braided hose."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Windguards",
    "explanation": "Wind steals heat and can blow out the flame. A double windguard, corner windblockers or a glass shield helps. Use a stove with at least one of them in open sites."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Safety systems",
    "explanation": "Look for canister ejection, safety locks or auto shut-off. The SHINESTAR lists all three. These reduce risk when a canister misbehaves."
