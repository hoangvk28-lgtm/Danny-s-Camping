Coletherm hollow polyester insulation and a Thermolock draft tube along the zipper are the two features that matter most on a freezing night.\n\nCompared with the Coleman Heritage, the mummy cut wastes less air around your body, so it has less space to heat. Against the HiZYNICE XXL, it carries a lower named rating and an adjustable hood instead of a cotton flannel lining.\n\nIt suits cold-weather car campers who want a shaped bag that still fits a larger frame.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort rating, not limit",
    "explanation": "A bag rating comes in layers: comfort is where an average sleeper stays warm, limit is where a cold-tolerant sleeper survives. Buying by the lowest number is the most common cold-weather mistake. Look for an explicit comfort figure on the listing and match it to the coldest night you expect."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mummy or rectangular shape",
    "explanation": "A mummy shape follows your body, so there is less empty air to warm. A rectangular bag gives room to roll and tuck in, but wastes heat. If you camp in real cold, shape matters nearly as much as the number on the tag."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Insulation weight and type",
    "explanation": "Synthetic fill like the Holofill 808 on the Coleman Heritage keeps insulating when damp and washes easily. More fill means more warmth and more bulk. Look for a named insulation type or fill weight rather than only a marketing phrase like winter grade."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Draft tubes and hood design",
    "explanation": "Heat escapes fastest at the zipper and around your neck. A draft tube behind the zipper and a cinchable hood close both leaks. Check the listing for a named draft tube and a hood drawstring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Your own height and bulk",
    "explanation": "A bag that is too short compresses insulation at the feet, and one that is too long leaves cold dead space. Match the maximum height a listing names to your own, with a few inches to spare. Also check packed size if the bag must ride in a small trunk."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad underneath matters",
    "explanation": "Insulation under you gets crushed flat, so a bag cannot warm the ground side. Most cold-night complaints are really weak pad complaints. Pair any bag here with an insulated pad rated for the same cold."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What does a comfort rating mean on a sleeping bag?",
    "a": "It is the lowest temperature at which an average sleeper should stay comfortable. The limit rating is colder and describes the point where a cold-tolerant sleeper starts to struggle. Always buy by comfort."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can these bags work with an insulated pad?",
    "a": "Yes, and they should. The HiZYNICE XXL, Coleman North Rim and the rest depend on a pad because insulation under your body gets compressed. A weak pad is the usual reason a good bag feels cold."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a mummy or a rectangular bag warmer?",
    "a": "A mummy is warmer for the same fill because it has less empty space to heat. A rectangular bag like the Coleman Heritage trades some of that for room to move. Choose by how cold the trip is."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a bag for a freezing night?",
    "a": "Fluff the bag before bed, wear dry socks and a hat, and cinch the hood. Keep the zipper draft tube lying flat behind the zipper. Eat something warm before you turn in."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a cold weather bag?",
    "a": "Keep it loosely stored or hung, not compressed, to protect the insulation. Spot clean the shell and wash it only when needed. A stuff sack is for travel, not for months in a closet."
