export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Running watts for your rig",
    "explanation": "Add the running watts of everything you will use together, then pick a generator that covers the total. A small 13,500 BTU air conditioner often needs around 1,500 running watts and a larger starting surge. The WEN 56477i at 4,000 rated watts has the headroom, while the 3,000-watt class suits one load at a time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "30A RV receptacle",
    "explanation": "Most travel trailers use a 30A TT-30R inlet. A generator with a built-in TT-30R lets you plug the shore cord in directly. Without one, an adapter is needed and the listing will not say it is included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise at 23 feet",
    "explanation": "Decibel ratings are measured at a set distance, usually 23 feet. A number near 53 to 58 dBA is roughly conversation level, while open frames can run louder. Look for the dBA figure and the load at which it was measured."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel and runtime",
    "explanation": "A bigger tank holds more fuel but adds weight. Runtime figures are usually at 25% load, which is much lighter than a trailer running an air conditioner. Plan fuel for your actual load, not the best case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide risk",
    "explanation": "Generators produce deadly carbon monoxide and must run outdoors, away from vents and sleeping areas. A shutdown sensor is a safeguard, not a license to run near the camper. Keep the exhaust pointed away from the RV."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 3,000-watt generator run my RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Sometimes, depending on the air conditioner's starting draw. A 13,500 BTU unit may need more than a 3,000-watt generator offers at start. Check your air conditioner's starting watts, or use a soft start device."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a TT-30R outlet?",
    "a": "If your trailer uses a 30A shore cord, a TT-30R lets you plug in directly. Without it you need an adapter. The WEN 56477i 4800, WEN 56360i 3600 and Oxseryn 4400 Inverter list RV receptacles."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is an inverter generator worth it over open frame?",
    "a": "Inverter units make cleaner power for laptops and chargers and run quieter. Open frame units cost less per watt but are louder. For a campground with quiet hours, an inverter is worth the premium."
  },
  {
    "q": "How far from my RV should I place the generator?",
    "a": "Keep it outdoors, well away from windows, doors and vents, with the exhaust pointed away. Many guides advise at least 20 feet, but follow the manual and campground rules. Never run it in an enclosed space."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep the generator healthy between trips?",
    "a": "Use a fuel stabilizer or run the fuel out of the carburetor before storage. Check the oil and clean the air filter periodically. Start it once a month for a few minutes to keep seals moving."
