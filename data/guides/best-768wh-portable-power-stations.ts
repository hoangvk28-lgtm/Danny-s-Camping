export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 768Wh gets you",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours measure stored energy, so 768Wh could run a 60W device for roughly 12 hours before losses. A 50W mini fridge averaging 25W could run for more than a day. Divide the capacity by your device's average watts for a rough runtime."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated output limits",
    "explanation": "A station's AC rating is the most it can supply at once, so a 600W unit cannot run a 1,000W kettle. Add up the watts of devices you want to run together and stay under the rating. Look for the figure next to AC outlet in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chemistry and cycle life",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) cells last for thousands of cycles and tolerate heat better than standard lithium-ion. Standard cells are lighter but wear faster. Check the title or bullets for LiFePO4 or LFP because many listings leave chemistry out."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pass-through and charging time",
    "explanation": "A station that can charge and power devices at the same time is useful for solar days. Charging time depends on the input watts, such as 1.6 hours on a fast AC input. Check the listed AC, solar and car input numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and portability",
    "explanation": "At 768Wh a station usually weighs 20 pounds or more, while 300Wh units can fall below 10 pounds. Weight affects whether you can carry it to a picnic table or keep it in the car. If the listing omits weight, look at the dimensions and ask the seller."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can 768Wh run a mini fridge?",
    "a": "Yes for many models, since a small fridge averages well under 100W, but check the fridge's watts. The Anker SOLIX C800X and Dabbsson 600L both have the capacity for several hours."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 768Wh enough for a CPAP machine?",
    "a": "It depends on the device. Ask your CPAP maker about using inverter-based power, because only the maker can confirm compatibility and runtime."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 1,200W worth it over 600W?",
    "a": "It is useful if you want to run a hot appliance or several loads at once. For laptops, lights and phones, the 600W of the Dabbsson 600L is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a station on the road?",
    "a": "Use the car port, an AC wall outlet or a solar panel that matches the input range. The Anker SOLIX C800X lists 80 percent solar charging in 2.3 hours with a suitable panel."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a station?",
