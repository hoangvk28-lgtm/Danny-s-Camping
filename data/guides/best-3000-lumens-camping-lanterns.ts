export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "How bright is 3000 lumens",
    "explanation": "3000 lumens fills a large room or a campsite, and it is far too bright for a small tent. A 3000 lumen lantern is only comfortable with dimming. Check how low the lantern can go."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery size and runtime",
    "explanation": "A 7500mAh pack gives hours on high and many hours on low, but the listing figure depends on the setting. Larger capacity means longer light. Look for mAh on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging methods",
    "explanation": "USB-C is the fastest, solar helps off-grid, and Qi wireless adds convenience. Charge the lantern fully before a trip. Check which methods the listing names."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Color and dimming",
    "explanation": "Warm white is easier on eyes, and red preserves night vision. Stepless dimming holds any level between low and full. Check the mode list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water rating",
    "explanation": "IP54 resists splashes and dust, not heavy rain. Bring the lantern under cover in storms. Look for the IP number on the listing."

    "q": "How do I charge the lantern?",
