export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What under $100 buys",
    "explanation": "At this price the insulation is usually synthetic fill or fleece, and the shell is water resistant rather than fully waterproof. Premium membranes and down are rare. Decide whether wind or wet is your main enemy before choosing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof vs water resistant",
    "explanation": "Water resistant fabric sheds light rain and snow, and waterproof construction has sealed seams or a membrane. Only waterproof jackets keep you dry in a steady downpour. Look for waterproof, seam and membrane wording on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Insulation type",
    "explanation": "Synthetic fill keeps warming when damp and dries fast, while fleece linings add warmth and weight. Quilted cotton can hold moisture. Look for synthetic insulation, fleece lining or fill type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hood and cuff seals",
    "explanation": "A hood with drawcord and adjustable cuffs stops wind from sneaking in at the collar and wrists. Missing seals feel colder than the temperature suggests. Check for adjustable hood, hook-and-loop cuffs and a hem drawcord."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit and layering",
