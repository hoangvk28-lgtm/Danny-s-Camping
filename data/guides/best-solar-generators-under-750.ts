export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "True kit price",
    "explanation": "A panel bundle can look expensive until you add the panel to a bare station. A 200W portable panel costs $150 to $250, so a $699 kit and a $499 bare unit plus a panel come out almost the same. Total the whole system before comparing price tags."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous vs surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are the sustained limit and surge only covers a 1 to 2 second start-up peak. A 1500W unit runs a toaster or kettle, a 1800W unit adds a small microwave, and 2400W runs a coffee maker with a fan. Check the continuous AC number, not just the surge number in the headline."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity against loads",
    "explanation": "Divide watt-hours by the load, then take about 85 percent for losses. A 1024Wh unit runs a 150W fridge for about 5.8 hours, and a 2150Wh unit for about 12. Add up your must-run devices and choose a battery that gives at least a day."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UPS switchover",
    "explanation": "A UPS mode swaps to battery in 10ms or less, which keeps desktops, routers and CPAPs running during an outage. Not every station offers it, and some take 20 to 30ms, which can restart a computer. If you want backup for equipment, look for the 10ms figure in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input capacity",
    "explanation": "Input from 200W to 1200W decides how quickly a day of sun refills the battery. A 200W panel adds roughly 600 to 800Wh on a sunny day, while a 1200W array can fill a 1.5 kWh battery in about 1.2 hours. Match the input rating to the panel array you plan to buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Expansion and warranty",
    "explanation": "Expandable systems like the ABOK Ark2000 let you add battery packs later at a cost, while fixed units cap your capacity. Warranty lengths range from 3 to 5 years among major brands. Check whether the warranty covers the cells, not only the electronics, and note how long the maker takes to ship a replacement. A longer warranty from a company with a US service center is worth more than a long promise with no local support."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 1 kWh solar generator run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Not for long. A 13,500 BTU RV air conditioner draws 1200 to 1500W running and more at start-up, so a 1070Wh battery lasts well under an hour. The ABOK Ark2000 or Lipower 2400W can handle the surge but still only runs it for 1 to 1.5 hours."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 200W panel enough for a 1 kWh battery?",
    "a": "It will refill roughly 600 to 800Wh on a bright summer day, so a full recharge takes 1.5 to 2 days. The BLUETTI Elite 100 V2 accepts up to 1000W of solar input, which cuts that dramatically if you add panels."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does a 10ms UPS do for me?",
    "a": "It switches to battery fast enough that a desktop, router or CPAP does not notice a grid dropout. The Lipower 2400W, BLUETTI Elite 100 V2 Kit and EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic list this feature. It only works if the unit stays plugged into the wall."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I add more batteries later?",
    "a": "Only on supported systems, such as the ABOK Ark2000 that expands to 4608Wh with Ark2000E packs. Fixed units such as the EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic cannot grow. If you might want more capacity, choose an expandable model now."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a large power station?",
    "a": "Keep it between 40 and 80 percent charge in a dry, cool room, and top it up every few months. Do not leave it in a hot garage or a car, and do not store it fully empty, which damages cells."
