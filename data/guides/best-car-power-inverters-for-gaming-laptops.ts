  "Gaming laptops ship with large power bricks, often well past what a slim 65W USB-C charger delivers, so a car inverter for one has to be sized by the brick rather than the laptop. That pushes the choice toward 500W units that can clamp straight to a battery.",
  "No listing here names gaming laptops, so this list is sized by watts and connection style. It pairs three 500W inverters that include battery clamps with one 300W plug-in that carries a 65W USB-C port, for lighter portable gaming machines."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Brick watts, not laptop watts",
    "explanation": "Check the label on your charger, since gaming laptops commonly ship with bricks well above 150W. If it reads 180W or more, a cigarette-socket plug-in cannot carry it. Pick an inverter whose continuous rating covers the brick with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery clamps for real power",
    "explanation": "A cigarette socket is usually fused near 10 to 15 amps, so only the clamps can supply a large brick. Clamp to a healthy battery with the engine running. Use thick cables and keep the leads short."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waveform and laptop chargers",
    "explanation": "Most laptop bricks run fine on standard output, while some motor or audio gear wants pure sine. The listing should name pure sine if it matters. Listings that say modified sine are fine for chargers only."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery drain",
    "explanation": "A 200W laptop at 12V draws roughly 17 amps plus conversion loss, which drains a starter battery quickly with the engine off. Run the engine, or use a deep-cycle battery. Check for a low-voltage shutoff."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuses and ventilation",
    "explanation": "Two named fuses protect both the leads and the unit. Keep vents clear of blankets and bags. Metal housings dissipate heat better under a gaming load."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I run a gaming laptop from the cigarette socket?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Reading the laptop's spec instead of the brick. The brick's output wattage is what the inverter sees. Add some headroom for the monitor or console."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 500W model worth it over 300W?",
    "a": "Yes for a big brick, no for a 65W USB-C laptop. The BESTEK 300W USB-C 65W Inverter is cheaper for the latter."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set one up?",

    "q": "Can it drain my battery?",
