export const buyingCriteria = [
  {

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Width and length",
    "explanation": "A 3 inch tape covers a small tear, and a 4 inch tape covers more. A long roll such as 63 or 79 inches gives you several repairs. Look at both numbers on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Clean and dry first",
    "explanation": "Adhesive tape grips best on a clean, dry surface. Dirt, water and sunscreen reduce the bond. Wipe the area and let it dry, as the listings advise."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Color and visibility",
    "explanation": "A black tape on a light tent shows from far away, and a clear tape hides better. Color does not change strength, but it changes how the tent looks. Check the color options on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seams and stress points",
    "explanation": "A patch on a flexing seam can peel sooner than one on a flat panel. Round the corners and press firmly. Look for flexible adhesive in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temporary or permanent",
    "explanation": "Most peel-and-stick tapes are field repairs, and a sewn or sealed repair lasts longer. Treat tape as the fix for a trip. Check whether the listing calls the bond permanent."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Will repair tape hold on a waterproof tent fabric?",
    "a": "Nylon tape bonds to nylon and polyester when the surface is clean and dry. Many tent walls have a coating, which can weaken the bond if it is oily. Wipe with alcohol and press firmly."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I put on a repair patch?",
    "a": "Clean and dry the tear, cut a patch with rounded corners, peel the backing and press firmly. Cover both sides if you can reach them. Rub for several seconds."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a roll or a patch set better for a tent kit?",
    "a": "A roll gives more total tape and cuts to any shape. A set of flat patches is easier to handle for small holes. Choose by how many repairs you expect."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use awning tape on a tent?",
    "a": "It can work for a rip in a thick tent floor or tarp. It is heavier and black, so it shows on a light tent. Choose nylon tape for a thin tent wall."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will repair tape wash off or peel?",
    "a": "Heavy flexing, wet fabric and dirt can lift the edges. Round the corners, press firmly and replace if it lifts. A sewn repair lasts longer for a repair you want to keep."
