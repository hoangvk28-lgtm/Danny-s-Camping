  {
    "criterion": "Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth",
    "explanation": "Bluetooth needs you to be close, while Wi-Fi can reach your phone through a network. Wi-Fi alerts help when you are away from the rig. Check which connections the listing names."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Replaceable module",
    "explanation": "A surge module absorbs spikes and wears out. A swappable module means you replace a small part after a strike. Look for module availability and price from the maker."

  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "IP65 means protection from dust and low-pressure water jets. It does not mean the unit can sit submerged. Keep plug connections raised off wet ground."

  {
    "criterion": "Check the joules",
    "explanation": "Neither listing prints a joule rating, which shows how much surge energy it absorbs. A higher figure generally means a longer life under repeated spikes. Look for the figure in the images or manual, and treat it as a question for the seller."
