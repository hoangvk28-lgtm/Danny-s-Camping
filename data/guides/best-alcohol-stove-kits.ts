The listing says it boils about 500 ml of water in around 7 minutes on denatured alcohol of 95 percent or more, not included.\n\nIt comes in two options, one with the windproof stand and an upgraded set that adds an empty bottle, rubber ring and storage bag. That stated boil time puts a number on performance that the Anodized Hiking Kit does not give.\n\nIt suits backpackers and tackle-box anglers who want a palm-sized burner with a stated boil time.

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Boil time",
    "explanation": "A stated boil time, such as 500 ml in around 7 minutes, lets you compare. Without it, you cannot plan fuel. Look for the volume with the time."

  {
    "criterion": "Stand and wind",
    "explanation": "A stand that blocks wind improves efficiency. Check it supports your pot. Windproof stands are best."

  {
    "q": "Why only two kits?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Do kits include fuel?",
    "a": "No. The Copper Vaporizer Kit states that alcohol is not included, and it names denatured alcohol of 95 percent or more. Buy a sealed bottle of fuel separately and carry it in a leak-proof container."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Copper Vaporizer Kit worth the higher price?",
    "a": "It is the only one here that states both a weight and a boil time, so you can plan fuel and pack weight. The Anodized Hiking Kit costs less and suits casual coffee stops. Choose by how much trip planning matters to you."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I light an alcohol stove kit safely?",
    "a": "Set the stove on a flat, stable surface outdoors and pour a small measured amount of alcohol. Light it with a lighter or match and let the flame settle before placing a pot. Put it out by covering the burner, not by blowing on it."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store the kit after a trip?",
    "a": "Let it cool fully, pour out any leftover fuel, and wipe soot from the burner and stand. Pack it in its bag so the pieces do not rub against other gear. A dry kit lasts longer."
