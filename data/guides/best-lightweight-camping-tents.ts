export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weight on the listing",
    "explanation": "A tent's weight should be a number, not an adjective. A 4.4 to 5.8 lb two-person tent is a light target, while a tent with no figure could be much heavier. Look for lb or kg in the title or bullets, and check whether it counts stakes and bag."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pole material",
    "explanation": "Aluminum poles flex back and resist snapping, while fiberglass is cheaper and heavier for its strength. That difference shows up in wind and in repeated pitching. Look for a series number or the word aluminum in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A PU 3000mm figure means the fabric resists water pressure up to that level before leaking. Seam tape matters as much as the number because seams are where light tents leak. Look for both a mm rating and taped or welded seams."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed dimensions",
    "explanation": "Weight and bulk are different problems. A 4.7 inch wide bundle slides in a pack pocket, while a 10 inch bundle eats pack space. Look for packed length and diameter, not just a bag photo."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor size per person",
    "explanation": "A two-person floor near 53 inches wide fits two pads with no gap. Light tents often cut width to save fabric. Compare the floor width in the listing with the sum of your pad widths."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 5 lb tent handle rain?",
    "a": "Yes if the fly and floor have a stated rating and taped seams. Night Cat 1-2 Person Clip Tent lists PU 3000 on both, and Forceatt 2-Person Backpacking Tent lists 3000mm. Check seams before trusting any light tent."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common lightweight tent mistake?",
    "a": "Trusting the word lightweight without a number. BISINNA 2-4 Person Backpacking Tent does not print a weight. Look for lb or kg before buying."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Forceatt worth it over the OLIXIS?",
    "a": "It costs about 49 dollars more and adds aluminum poles, a second vestibule and a printed waterproof rating. OLIXIS 2-Person Dome Tent weighs only about 0.3 lb more. Pay for the Forceatt if you hike often."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch a clip-style tent?",
    "a": "Lay out the body, feed the poles through the corner eyelets and clip the body to the frame. Then add the fly and stake the corners. Night Cat 1-2 Person Clip Tent can be done solo in a few minutes."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a light tent dry and long-lived?",
    "a": "Dry the fly and floor fully before packing, and wipe the floor of grit. Store loose, not tightly packed. Re-seal seams if you see leaking at stitching."
