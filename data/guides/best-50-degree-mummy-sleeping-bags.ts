  {
    "criterion": "Why few 50F mummies exist",
    "explanation": "Tapered mummy bags are built to save heat, so most are rated colder than 50F. A 50F mummy is a niche item. Check that the number on the listing is a comfort or rating figure rather than an extreme limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort, limit and extreme",
    "explanation": "Comfort is where an average sleeper stays warm, limit is where they survive curled up, and extreme is a survival figure. The Bessport lists all three styles of number. Plan your night around comfort."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mummy versus hooded rectangle",
    "explanation": "A mummy tapers at the feet and shoulders, which traps less air. A hooded rectangle gives more room but loses more heat. Check the listing for the shape word, not just a hood."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Girth and length",
    "explanation": "Girth at the shoulder, hip and foot tells you how snug a bag fits. A mummy that is too tight compresses insulation and chills you. Compare printed numbers with your own."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "Mild-weather mummies should weigh little, but this pair weighs more than ultralight options. Look for a printed weight on the listing. If none appears, plan for a heavier bag."

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with mummy ratings?",
    "a": "They read the extreme figure as a comfort number. The Bessport title shows 15F, which is an extreme figure. Plan around the 50 to 68F comfort range."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Bessport worth over the Amazon Basics?",
    "a": "If you want a mummy fit and cold margin, yes. If you camp in summer only, the Amazon Basics 50F is cheaper. Pick by your coldest night."

  {
    "q": "How do I set up a mummy bag?",
