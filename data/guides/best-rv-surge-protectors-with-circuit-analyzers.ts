export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What a circuit analyzer checks",
    "explanation": "An analyzer tests the pedestal for open ground, open neutral, reversed polarity and high or low voltage. A fault can damage appliances even before a surge occurs. Look for the list of faults on the listing and check whether the unit shows numbers or just lights."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joules explained",
    "explanation": "Joules measure how much surge energy a protector can absorb before it wears out. A higher number lasts longer, but every surge uses some of it. Look for the stated joule rating, and replace the unit after a big strike."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Auto disconnect",
    "explanation": "Surge protection alone cannot fix low voltage, which can damage air conditioners. A unit with auto disconnect cuts power when voltage leaves the safe range. Look for the words auto power disconnect in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "50 amp fit",
    "explanation": "These units fit 4-prong 50 amp pedestals. A 30 amp rig needs a 30 amp unit or an adapter plus matching protection. Check your RV's plug shape before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather cover",
    "explanation": "Pedestals sit in rain and dust, and a cover keeps water off the connection. A right-angle plug helps with cord strain. Look for a cover and an IP rating on the listing."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a surge protector with a circuit analyzer?",
    "a": "It is a smart check at unfamiliar pedestals. The analyzer finds wiring faults that a plain surge protector ignores. The TGJOR 50A Analyzer, FOCSPROD 16000J and GEARGO 13000J all include one."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with RV surge protectors?",
    "a": "Plugging in the rig before reading the lights. Always connect the protector first, wait for the lights or screen, and only then turn on the main breaker."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the TGJOR worth it over the FOCSPROD?",
    "a": "If you want a screen and auto cutoff, yes. The TGJOR 50A Analyzer is the only one with both, while the FOCSPROD 16000J is cheaper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a surge protector?",
    "a": "Plug it into the pedestal first, check the lights, then connect the RV cord to it. Use the grip handles to plug and unplug."
  },
  {
    "q": "When should I replace a surge protector?",
    "a": "After a large surge or if the protection light fails. Each surge uses up part of the joule rating, so replace it if it stops indicating protected."
