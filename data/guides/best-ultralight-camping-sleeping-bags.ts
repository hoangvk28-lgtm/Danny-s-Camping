export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weight versus warmth",
    "explanation": "Every ounce saved is warmth lost, and 1.5 lb bags rated for 50 to 70F cannot handle a frosty night. Match the weight to your lowest temperature. Check the printed range, not just the weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed size",
    "explanation": "A bag that stuffs to 11 x 6 inches fits a small pack. Larger bags take pack space even at the same weight. Check packed dimensions in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ripstop versus plain nylon",
    "explanation": "Ripstop weave stops small tears from spreading, which matters for a thin shell. A 380T ripstop is stronger for its weight than plain fabric. Look for ripstop wording."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Width and breathing",
    "explanation": "A 30 inch envelope is narrow and holds heat poorly when a sleeper moves. Wider bags use more fabric but feel less confining. Check the printed width."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad pairing",
    "explanation": "An ultralight bag relies on your pad for ground insulation. A thin bag over a thin pad leaves you cold. Plan an R 2 or higher pad for warm-weather trips."

  {
    "q": "Is the Tracker worth it over the NewDoar?",
    "a": "If your nights drop toward freezing, yes. The TETON Tracker 5F is rated far colder but prints no weight. For summer, the NewDoar Ultralight is lighter."
