export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Vehicle compatibility",
    "explanation": "Most SUV tents need an upward-opening rear hatch or liftgate, and some do not work with sedans, pickups or side-door vans. A sleeve attachment must fit your car's opening, so measure the hatch width. Look for the compatibility note in the title and bullet points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor and standing height",
    "explanation": "An 8 by 8 foot floor suits two adults with gear, while 10 by 8 feet suits a small family of four. A 7.2 foot ceiling lets most adults stand without ducking, which makes changing clothes far easier. Compare the dimensions on the product page, and think about your air mattress size before you decide."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating and seams",
    "explanation": "PU2000 handles showers and dry-season trips, while PU3000 handles steady rain much better. Sealed or taped seams matter just as much as the coating, because water gets in at the stitching first. Look for the PU figure and any note on seam sealing in the product details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standalone versus attached",
    "explanation": "A tent that detaches from the vehicle lets you drive to the store without breaking camp, while a fixed attachment ties up the car. Check that the sleeve comes off and that the tent can pitch alone on four poles. This matters most on multi-night trips."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Engine and exhaust safety",
    "explanation": "Never run the engine with the hatch open into a closed tent, because exhaust can seep inside the sleeping space. Park with the tailpipe pointed away from the tent and keep two windows open for airflow. Use a battery CO alarm any time you sleep inside the tent or vehicle."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does my SUV need an upward-opening hatch?",
    "a": "Yes, nearly every SUV tent attaches to an upward-swinging liftgate or hatch. Sedans, pickups and side-door vans usually do not work. The Hatchback Tent and Awning states this clearly, so read the fitment note on any tent before ordering."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I sleep inside the SUV and use the tent for space?",
    "a": "Yes, many people sleep in the cargo area and use the attached tent as a living room. The JOYTUTUS Tailgate covers the roof so the whole vehicle becomes part of the shelter. Fold the rear seats flat and add a pad."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does PU3000 beat PU2000 here?",
    "a": "Yes in rainy climates, since PU3000 resists more water pressure before leaking through the fabric. The Waterproof SUV Tent PU3000 also has sealed seams, which helps at the stitching. For fair-weather trips the Portal 5-Person Porch is enough and costs about $50 less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I attach the sleeve?",
    "a": "Open the hatch, drape the sleeve over the opening and tighten the straps around the frame. Close the strap loops, then stake out the tent and fit the poles. Two people make the first setup much easier, and practice at home helps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I prevent leaks around the sleeve?",
    "a": "Make sure the sleeve overlaps the hatch seal and tighten the straps firmly against the frame. Add a small tarp over the top join if heavy rain is forecast. Check the hatch gasket for gaps, since water often enters there first."
