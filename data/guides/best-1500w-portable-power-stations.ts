export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watts versus watt-hours",
    "explanation": "A 1500W rating describes how hard it can push, and watt-hours describe how long. A 1070Wh station at 1500W runs for under 40 minutes, while a 2kWh station runs about 70 minutes. Check both numbers against your appliance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge for motors",
    "explanation": "Fridge compressors and fans can draw several times their running watts at start. A 3000W surge rating covers that for a moment. Look at the peak and surge in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cycle life",
    "explanation": "A 3000-cycle LiFePO4 pack lasts about 8 years of daily use, and a 10,000-cycle LFP pack lasts decades on paper. If you use it often, cycles matter. Check the cycle figure and the years claimed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fast charging versus storage",
    "explanation": "Rapid charging gets you back to full in an hour, but the power draw is high and needs a strong outlet. Slow charging is easier on a generator or solar setup. Check the AC input rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",

  },
  {
    "q": "How long will it run a fridge?",
    "a": "A typical fridge uses around 100 watts when cycling, so 1070Wh lasts about 8 hours and 2kWh lasts about 18. Listings quote more for efficient fridges."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bundle with solar panels worth it?",
    "a": "It is if you will recharge off-grid. Check that the panels' voltage range suits the station."
