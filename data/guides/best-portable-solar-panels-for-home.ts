export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Panel wattage versus station input",
    "explanation": "A 150W panel does not charge faster than your station allows. Many portable stations cap solar input at 60 to 100W, so a bigger panel can waste capacity. Check your station's maximum solar input before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Connector compatibility",
    "explanation": "Panels and stations use different plugs, such as DC8020, XT60 and Anderson. A 5-in-1 cable covers more cases than a 4-in-1 cable. Check your station's input port name and the connectors in the panel's listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and fold size",
    "explanation": "A panel you can lift with one hand is a panel you will actually deploy. A 4 lb panel feels easy, while a 9 lb panel is a chore for some. Check weight and folded size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "IP67 means the panel resists dust and brief immersion, which handles rain. A rating without a number is not a guarantee. Look for the IP number and the surface material, such as ETFE."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge controller",
    "explanation": "A panel that connects straight to a power station does not need a separate controller. A 12V battery does need one. Check whether a PWM or MPPT controller is included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Realistic output at home",
    "explanation": "Panels rarely produce their rated watts, since angle, shade and clouds cut output. Plan on about half in typical use. Place the panel in direct sun and tilt it toward the sun."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How many watts do I need to charge a power station at home?",
    "a": "A 100W panel refills a small station over a few sunny days. Bigger stations need more panels or a longer wait."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a portable panel into any power station?",
    "a": "Not always. Match the connector and the station's maximum solar input. ZOUPW 100W Foldable includes a 5-in-1 cable to cover many plugs."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 150W panel worth it over a 100W panel?",
    "a": "Only if your station accepts more than 100W of input. DOKIO 150W Panel Kit lists a note that many stations cap at 60 to 100W."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a portable panel during an outage?",
    "a": "Place it in direct sun, angle it toward the sun and connect it to the station. FlexSolar 100W Ultralight sets up in moments on a porch or in a yard."
  },
