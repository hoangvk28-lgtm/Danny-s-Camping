It uses PU3000 coated polyester over 7.9mm fiberglass poles and adds a double-layer door with a mesh inner panel.\n\nNext to the Wakeman 2P it gives up about 1.5 lb of carry weight and gains several inches of length and width. Against the Sutekus Solo it sleeps two instead of one and carries a stated waterproof coating rather than only a fabric denier.\n\nIt suits car campers on a tight budget who want two adults to stretch out without bumping the walls.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Floor size versus sleepers",
    "explanation": "Floor size is the stated length and width, and it matters more than the person rating on the label. A true two-person floor needs about 50 inches of width so two pads can sit side by side. Check the dimensions rather than the 2P badge, and add 6 inches of length beyond your height."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof coating rating",
    "explanation": "A PU coating rating, such as PU3000, tells you the water column the fabric resists before leaking, measured in millimeters. Anything under about 1500mm is a fair-weather fabric, while 3000mm is a sensible floor for steady rain. Look for the number in the title or bullets, and treat a tent with no number as dry-weather only."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pole material and flex",
    "explanation": "Fiberglass poles are the norm under $30 because they are cheap, but they flex in wind and can splinter after a few seasons. Aluminum poles resist bending and cost more. Pick a tent with a pole repair sleeve or buy spare poles, and stake out guy lines in any breeze."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Door and ventilation design",
    "explanation": "A single-layer tent with no vents traps breath moisture and drips condensation on sleepers. Mesh windows, a screen door layer or vent holes let humid air escape while bugs stay outside. Count the mesh panels, and make sure a rain fly can cover them without sealing every vent shut. Two opposite openings give the best cross breeze on a warm night."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carry weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "A tent that weighs under 3 lb suits walk-in sites and a tent over 4 lb is fine for car camping. Packed size matters too, because a long pole bag will not fit a small daypack. Check the listed weight and the packed length before ordering."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a tent under $30 waterproof enough for rain?",
    "a": "Only if it states a coating rating. The JELUCAMP Dome lists PU3000 polyester, which handles light to steady rain when pitched with its fly and taut guy lines. Tents without a rating, like the Wakeman D-Door 2P, are best kept for dry forecasts."
  },
  {
    "q": "How many people really fit in a budget 2 person tent?",
    "a": "Expect two adults on narrow pads with little gear space. The Wakeman Lightweight 2P is 57 inches wide, which fits two slim pads shoulder to shoulder. For comfort, buy the next size up or pick the wider JELUCAMP Dome."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Wind Tour Pop-Up worth it over a pole tent?",
    "a": "It is worth it when setup speed matters more than structure, such as for kids or beach trips. A pole tent such as the JELUCAMP Dome holds shape better in wind and packs flatter. If your campsite is exposed, choose the pole tent."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch a cheap tent so it lasts?",
    "a": "Stake all corners, tension the guy lines and keep the fly taut so rain does not pool in folds. Set the tent on a smooth patch and clear sharp stones before laying the floor. A cheap ground cloth under the floor protects thin fabric."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I clean and store a budget tent?",
    "a": "Dry the tent fully before packing, because wet nylon mildews within days. Wipe the floor with a damp cloth and avoid washing machines, which strip coatings. Loosely fold it in a cool, dry closet to protect the waterproof layer."
