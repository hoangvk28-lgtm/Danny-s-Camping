export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Wh limit for flights",
    "explanation": "Airlines allow banks up to 100Wh in carry-on, and a 27,000mAh bank at 3.6V is about 98Wh, right at the line. A 146Wh bank needs approval and cannot fly on many airlines. Check the Wh on the label before you pack, and the airline decides, so a bank at the line may be refused by one agent and accepted by another."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C vs AC",
    "explanation": "USB-C banks charge laptops efficiently and weigh less, while AC outlets run a standard laptop brick and other plug-in devices at 10 to 20 percent loss. A 100W AC outlet cannot run a kettle. Check which ports your gear needs, so a USB-C laptop charger and a USB-C bank are the lighter pairing and an AC bank the more flexible."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous vs peak watts",
    "explanation": "A 100W continuous AC outlet with a 150W surge runs a laptop brick (65W) and a fan, not a hair dryer. Peak ratings last a second. Check the continuous watts, and a coffee maker or hair dryer of 800W or more is beyond every bank here."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge speed",
    "explanation": "A 65W USB-C input refills a 20,000mAh bank in about 1.5 hours, while a 60W input fills the MARBERO in 2 hours. A slow charger takes all night. Check the input wattage and the charger you need, and a bank that takes 8 hours to refill will not be ready for a morning departure after an evening charge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input",
    "explanation": "A bank that accepts a 13 to 23V panel can recharge off-grid. A 100W panel adds about 300Wh a day. Check the input voltage range, and the panel must be in the 13 to 23V range and have a plug that fits the bank, and check the plug type too."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight",
    "explanation": "A USB-C bank weighs about 1 lb, while AC banks weigh 2 to 4 lb. Weight matters if you carry it. Check the lb figure, and a 4 lb AC bank in a hiking pack is hard to justify, while in a car it is invisible."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a power bank run a laptop?",
    "a": "Yes if its output meets the laptop's charger wattage. The UGREEN Nexode 100W 20K and INIU 25000mAh 100W provide 100W over USB-C, while the AC banks provide a 100W outlet for a laptop brick. Check the laptop's adapter label, and USB-C laptops are the easiest to pair."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I fly with the Apowking 146Wh?",
    "a": "Not normally. At 146Wh it exceeds the 100Wh carry-on limit and needs airline approval up to 160Wh. The Paopaoyu 27000mAh AC Bank at 98Wh is under the limit. Check the airline's policy, and check the airline site before packing."
  },
  {
    "q": "What happens if I exceed the AC wattage?",
    "a": "The bank shuts off or trips protection, which is safe but stops the device. A 100W AC bank cannot run a 1200W hair dryer. Add up the wattage of what you plug in, and the unit restarts after you unplug the load."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does a 98Wh bank run a laptop?",
    "a": "About 1.5 to 2 charges for a 50Wh laptop, or 3 to 4 hours of use for a 30W laptop. A gaming laptop drains it in an hour. Check your laptop's battery size, and a lighter load lasts longer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I charge these from a car?",
    "a": "Yes, with a 12V car USB-C adapter rated 30 to 65W. The MARBERO 88.8Wh AC Bank accepts 60W input, so a strong adapter refills it in a couple of hours. Run the engine while charging so you do not drain the car battery."
