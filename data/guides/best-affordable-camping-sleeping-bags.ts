export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What a low price buys",
    "explanation": "A bag around 20 to 30 dollars gives a basic synthetic fill and a simple shell. Weight is higher and ratings are modest. Spend your money on a good pad instead if you can only afford one upgrade."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Season labels versus ratings",
    "explanation": "A word like 4-season is marketing, while a comfort range is a number. Prefer listings that print the number. Look for a range with a low end and a high end."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort range",
    "explanation": "A comfort range such as 50 to 80F tells you the nights it suits. Below the low end you need layers. Match it to forecast lows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "Cheap bags tend to be heavier. A printed weight like 1.7 lb or 1.35 kg lets you compare. Without a figure, assume more weight."

  {
    "q": "Is the PTEROMY worth over the OBTANIM?",
    "a": "Yes if you want a comfort range and a stated weight. The OBTANIM Waterproof costs less but prints less. Spend a few dollars more for the printed numbers."
  },

    "q": "How do I set up a cheap bag?",
    "a": "Fluff it and lay it over a pad. Use layers on a cool night. Vent with the bottom zipper on the PTEROMY Hollowfiber."
