export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "UV400 versus polarized",
    "explanation": "UV400 means the lens blocks ultraviolet light up to 400 nanometers, which is the real eye protection. Polarization is a separate feature that cuts glare off water and roads. Check that the listing names both, since a polarized lens without UV400 is not enough."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Frame hinges and material",
    "explanation": "Cheap frames often fail at the hinge, which is where metal hinges or spring hinges help. A flexible frame survives a pack better than a stiff one. Look for metal hinges, spring hinges or a named flexible plastic."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lens size and fit",
    "explanation": "A lens that is too small leaves gaps for light to come around the edge, and a very wide frame slips on a narrow face. Compare the listed lens width and frame width with your own pair. Use the numbers on the listing and not the size label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-pack versus single pair",
    "explanation": "A multi-pack gives spares, but each pair is usually a basic design. A single pair can have better hinges and a better case. Choose based on how often you lose or break glasses."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Case, strap and test card",
    "explanation": "A hard case protects lenses in a pack, a strap saves a pair on a bike or boat, and a test card lets you check the polarization yourself. These small items matter on the trail. Look at the box contents on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty and returns",

  },
  {
    "q": "Is a multi-pack worth it over a single pair?",
    "a": "If you lose or break glasses often, yes. A four-pack like the FURISHQI Retro 4-Pack gives spares. If you want better hinges, choose a single pair like the Ofwin."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I test if lenses are polarized?",
    "a": "Use the polarized test card or look at a screen through the lens and rotate it. A polarized lens will darken a screen at some angles. The Ofwin and MEETSUN sport pairs list a test card."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I clean polarized lenses?",
