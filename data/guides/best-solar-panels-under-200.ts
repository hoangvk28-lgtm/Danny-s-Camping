export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rigid or portable",
    "explanation": "A rigid 200W panel gives the same watts for $20 to $55 less and lasts for decades on a roof, while a portable panel folds and plugs straight into a station. Portables weigh 14 to 19 lb and run hotter. Decide whether the panel stays or moves."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage",
    "explanation": "A 12V or 24V rigid panel needs a controller, while a portable panel with 18 to 24V output connects to a station. A 24V panel needs MPPT for a 12V battery. Check the nominal and open-circuit voltage, and a 24V panel into a controller built only for 12V can overheat it or trip its input protection, so read the controller manual before you buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bifacial and N-type",
    "explanation": "N-type cells lose less in heat and low light, and a bifacial panel adds 10 to 30 percent over a reflective surface. On a dark RV roof the bifacial gain is small. Check what the panel will sit over, and mounting a bifacial panel a foot above light gravel or sand gives a more honest gain than laying it flat on a dark roof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C power delivery",
    "explanation": "A USB-C PD port at 45 to 60W charges a laptop or phone directly from the panel without a station. It only works in good sun, and output drops in cloud. Check the PD wattage in the specs, and since a laptop needs 45 to 65W while sun is strongest at midday, plan on charging it during the day, not at night."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "A 13.89 lb portable panel is easy to carry, while a 19 lb panel is a chore after a long day. Rigid panels weigh about 25 lb. Check the weight and the folded size, so lift a 19 lb panel from your trunk to the picnic table in your mind before you buy it, because a heavy panel often stays at home."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Degradation and warranty",
    "explanation": "Panels lose 1 percent in year one and about 0.4 percent a year after, so a 25-year panel still makes about 90 percent. Warranties run from 5 to 25 years. Check the output and workmanship terms, so a longer output warranty only helps if the maker still exists when you need to claim, which favors established brands."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a 200W panel with a 100W power station?",
    "a": "Yes, but the station will cap the input at its limit, so you gain no charging speed. Check the station's maximum solar input and match the panel. A larger panel helps in cloudy conditions and it also helps on cloudy days."
  },
  {
    "q": "How many 200W panels do I need?",
    "a": "One 200W panel makes about 600 to 800Wh a day, so a fridge and lights need one or two. A power station of 1000Wh needs one or two panels for a day. Add panels for faster refills."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is MPPT worth it with a 200W panel?",
    "a": "Yes, an MPPT controller gets 10 to 30 percent more from the panel than PWM, which pays back the $40 or more in a season. The Renogy 200W N-Type at 24V needs it. Check that the controller handles your panel voltage."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do portable panels last as long as rigid?",
    "a": "Portable panels use ETFE coating that lasts several years of regular travel, but they get folded, which wears the cells. Rigid panels last 25 years. Treat portables as a 5 to 10 year purchase, and store them dry and flat."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep panels working at their best?",
    "a": "Keep them clean, angled toward the sun and out of shade, and keep cables from sharp edges. Heat cuts output, so allow airflow. Check connectors for corrosion each season, and wipe off dust with a soft cloth and plain water."
