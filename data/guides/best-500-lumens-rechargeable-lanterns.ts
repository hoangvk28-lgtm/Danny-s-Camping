It runs on a built-in 2000mAh battery that charges over USB-C, with four AA batteries as backup.\n\nIt is the only pick here that states 500 lumens, and the dial gives a far wider low-end range than the five fixed modes on the Westinghouse 1000 Lumen. The AA backup also keeps it running when no charger is near.\n\nIt suits campers and storm-prep households who want a warm, dimmable lantern for a tent, patio or nightstand.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 500 lumens looks like",
    "explanation": "Five hundred lumens fills a tent or lights a table at close range, and it is about the brightness of a mid-size household LED bulb. Higher figures help only when you light a large area from one point. Read the stated lumens at the top step, and assume a lower figure when dimmed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low-end dimming range",
    "explanation": "A lantern that dims to 5 or 10 lumens is much more comfortable in a tent at night than one that bottoms out at 100. This is the setting you will use most. Look for the minimum lumen number in the listing, or a stepless dial rather than two or three fixed steps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warm versus daylight white",
    "explanation": "Warm light around 2700K to 3000K is easier on the eyes and attracts fewer insects than blue-white light. Daylight white around 5000K shows color and detail better for cooking or repairs. Check the listing for a color temperature figure or a mode that switches tones."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Backup power options",
    "explanation": "A built-in battery is convenient until it runs flat in a long power cut. Lanterns that accept AA batteries or a solar panel can recover without a wall outlet. Read the listing for backup battery type and whether the cells are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP rating wording",
    "explanation": "Terms such as water-resistant are vague, while IPX4 means protection against splashes from any direction. If your lantern will sit in drizzle, the exact code tells you whether to trust it. Look for the IP code in the specs, and treat missing codes as unknown."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is 500 lumens enough for a campsite?",
    "a": "It lights a table or tent well. For a whole campsite with several people, a 1000 lumen unit such as the Westinghouse 1000 Lumen reaches further."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can the LUXPRO run on AA batteries?",
    "a": "The listing says it runs on a built-in 2000mAh rechargeable pack or four AA backup batteries. Keep a fresh set in the lantern so it works when the pack is empty."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are the single lanterns the same as the 2-pack?",
    "a": "The LUXPRO is sold as a 2-pack in sage green and as single lanterns in white and black. The listings describe the same 500 lumen retro design, so choose by color and count."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use a lantern in a tent safely?",
    "a": "Hang it from a loop or set it on a flat surface away from the sleeping bag. Use a low warm setting for the night, and keep it out of rain even if the listing says water-resistant."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will the battery last?",
    "a": "Runtime depends on the brightness level. The LUXPRO listing quotes up to 320 hours on low, and the figure drops fast near 500 lumens, so keep spare batteries or a charger on long trips."
