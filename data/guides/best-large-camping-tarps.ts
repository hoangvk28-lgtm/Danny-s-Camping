export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Real dimensions in feet",
    "explanation": "A large tarp has to cover your table and chairs plus a margin. A label like large or XL says nothing, while 17 x 10 ft or 19 x 14 ft can be measured against your gear. Look for the length and width in the title or the first bullet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof coating",
    "explanation": "PU coatings carry millimeter ratings such as 3000mm or 6000mm, while plain poly relies on its thickness in mils. Higher mm means more water pressure resisted. Check for the number and whether seams are heat-pressed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "Large tarps add pounds fast, so a lighter fabric changes whether you can carry it. A listed weight such as 4.7 pounds tells you more than a size name. Look for weight and packed dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tie-out spacing",
    "explanation": "A big tarp sags between anchors, so grommets or loops every two feet or less keep it tight. Wide spacing makes it flap. Look for the spacing or a count of tie-down points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Poles and stakes in the kit",
    "explanation": "A large roof needs supports and anchors, and you may need extra to rig it. A kit with a pole and stakes saves money. Check the package list for pole, stake and guyline counts."

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest large tarp mistake?",
    "a": "Rigging it with a single center pole. A large sheet needs support points at several spots or it pools water. Use trees, poles and guylines together."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the HipierFx worth it over the HOEYITO?",
    "a": "If you need the extra area for eight or more people, yes. The HOEYITO gives a higher rating, lower weight and a bigger stake kit for far less. Choose by group size."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I rig a large tarp?",
    "a": "Stretch a ridge or lean-to between two anchors, stake the corners and tighten the guylines. Tilt one side lower so water runs off. Add a pole in the middle for sag."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a large tarp?",
