export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Pole thickness and wind",
    "explanation": "An 8mm fiberglass pole bends and springs back in gusts, while a 5mm pole may kink or snap. Thicker poles add a little weight but protect your investment over many trips. Look for the pole diameter in the product details, and choose 8mm or steel for exposed beaches."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sandbags and stakes",
    "explanation": "Sandbags hold best when filled completely, and stakes hold best in damp, packed sand. Using both together gives the safest hold in changing wind. Look for at least three sandbags or four stakes included, and bring a few extra stakes for loose sand, and re-check the bags if the wind shifts during the day."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Umbrella versus enclosed shelter",
    "explanation": "An umbrella-style canopy gives wide, breezy shade but no walls, while an enclosed tent gives privacy and wind shelter but holds heat. Choose by whether you want to change clothes or lounge. Open canopies suit groups with chairs, and pitch an open canopy so the back faces the prevailing wind."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pop-up discs versus frame tents",
    "explanation": "Pop-up discs open in seconds but fold into a twisted circle that takes practice, and they use thinner poles. Frame tents take a few minutes and pack flat. Think about the walk to the beach and who will fold the tent at the end, and fold with a friend if you can because the twist is easier with two people."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UPF 50+ and reflected sun",
    "explanation": "UPF 50+ fabric blocks most direct UV but not the light that bounces off sand and water. Wear sunscreen even in the shade, and look for UPF 50+ in the title. Silver coatings help but wear off with abrasion, which is why a hat still matters under any shelter."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What size beach tent do I need for four people?",
    "a": "A floor near 8 ft by 5.5 ft fits four beach chairs. The Wolfwise 3-4P Cabana is sized for that. For loungers or a cooler, choose a canopy such as the UPWELL Umbrella Canopy, which spreads over about 10.5 ft."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are pop-up beach tents safe in wind?",
    "a": "Only with full anchoring. Pop-up discs lift easily, so use sandbags, stakes and wind ropes together. The EchoSmile 4P Pop-Up includes all three, and you should still take it down if gusts exceed a stiff breeze, and take it down before storms arrive."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is an umbrella canopy better than a tent?",
    "a": "It gives more open shade and airflow, but no walls. The UPWELL Umbrella Canopy covers about 10.5 ft by 8 ft and includes a removable sunwall. Pick an enclosed tent for privacy and wind shelter, and it folds into a long bag that fits a car trunk."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I fold a pop-up beach tent?",
    "a": "Twist the frame into a flat circle, loop it into thirds and slide it into the bag. Practice at home on grass, because the first fold is the hardest. Keep the original ties to hold the loops."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean a beach tent after a trip?",
    "a": "Rinse with fresh water to remove salt and sand, dry it fully in shade and brush the sand out of zippers. Store it loosely folded in a dry place. Salt left on poles causes rust, and let the zippers dry open before closing them."
