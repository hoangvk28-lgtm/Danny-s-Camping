export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "AGM versus LiFePO4 at 100Ah",
    "explanation": "Both give 100Ah on paper, but lead-acid should not be drained much below half, while lithium can go much deeper. That makes the usable capacity of a lithium 100Ah closer to 100Ah. Compare the usable range, not just the label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Depth of discharge and cycle life",
    "explanation": "A cycle claim only means something with the depth it was measured at. CHITOLI lists three depths, others list one. Compare at the depth you will use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature limits",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid and lithium have different charge limits, and lithium should not be charged when frozen. The WEIZE lists 14 to 122 degrees F for charging. Check the listing for your climate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger compatibility",
    "explanation": "Lithium needs about 14.4 to 14.6V, and AGM uses a different profile. A mismatched charger undercharges or harms the battery. Check the charger before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Box fit, fusing and ventilation",

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake?",
    "a": "Using the wrong charger. Lithium needs a 14.4 to 14.6V profile. Check before buying."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is lithium worth it over AGM at 100Ah?",
    "a": "If weight and cycle life matter, yes. The CHITOLI 100Ah Group 24 lists 4000+ cycles at 100 percent depth. AGM batteries keep a familiar lead-acid charging profile."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire a 100Ah battery?",
    "a": "Use a fuse near the positive terminal, correct cable gauge and tight connections. Follow the Renogy 100Ah AGM instructions for parallel limits. Keep it ventilated."
  },
