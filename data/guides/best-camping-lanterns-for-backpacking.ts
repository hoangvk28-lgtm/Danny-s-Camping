export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack volume",
    "explanation": "Weight is what you feel after ten miles, and collapsed size decides what else fits in the pack. A light listed at 8 ounces behaves very differently from an unlisted weight. Look for an ounce or gram figure and a stated packed height in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Power source on the trail",
    "explanation": "Built-in rechargeable cells need a power bank or sun, while AA and AAA cells can be swapped anywhere. On trips longer than three nights, spare batteries often weigh more than a small charging bank. Check whether batteries are included and what charge cable is in the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real brightness for camp tasks",
    "explanation": "Backpacking tasks such as cooking, reading and tent setup need roughly 100 to 300 lumens, not thousands. Very high lumen claims often drain a small battery in an hour or two. Look for brightness levels and the runtime listed at each."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water and impact resistance",
    "explanation": "A lantern strapped to a pack faces rain, drops and condensation. IPX4 resists splashes, IPX5 handles jets and IP67 handles brief immersion. Read the actual IP number rather than the word waterproof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hanging and standing options",
    "explanation": "A light you cannot hang is hard to use in a small tent. A hook, magnet or handle puts the light overhead, where it spreads best. Look for the hanging method named on the listing and check it fits your tent loops."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Single light or multi-pack",
    "explanation": "Packs offer a light per tent or per person and lower the cost of each lamp. A single lantern is simpler and usually brighter. Think about group size before choosing."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How bright should a backpacking lantern be?",
    "a": "Around 100 to 300 lumens is plenty for cooking and reading in camp. More light drains the battery faster and rarely helps inside a small tent. Most of the picks here fall within that range."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common backpacking lantern mistake?",
    "a": "Buying a heavy, high-lumen light and then leaving it at home. A packable model you actually carry beats a brighter one that stays in the car. Check weight and packed size first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is an inflatable lantern worth it over a collapsible one?",
    "a": "An inflatable such as the LuminAID Nova Inflatable packs flatter and handles water well. A collapsible like the DIBMS Solar Collapsible is brighter and charges by USB as well as sun. Pick the inflatable for wet trips and the collapsible for brightness."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a solar lantern on the trail?",
    "a": "Clip it to the outside of your pack or set it in direct sun while you cook or rest. Direct sun gives the fastest charge, and clouds can slow it a lot. A small USB power bank is a good backup."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep lantern batteries from draining in the pack?",
    "a": "Make sure the switch cannot be bumped on by turning it fully off or removing a battery. Pack it in a pocket away from the stove. Store it with a partial charge between trips."
