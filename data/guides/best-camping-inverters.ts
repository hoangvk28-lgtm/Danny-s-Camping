export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts is what the inverter can supply all day, while surge or peak watts is a short burst for a motor starting. A fridge or pump may need two or three times its running watts at startup. Add up the running watts of everything you plan to use at once and pick an inverter whose continuous rating covers it with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Vehicle socket limits",
    "explanation": "A 12V cigarette socket is usually fused around 10 to 15 amps, which is roughly 120 to 180 watts of real power. A plug-in listed at 300W or 400W cannot deliver that through the socket, so treat the big number as a ceiling rather than a promise. Check the listing for a socket warning, and for anything over about 150W use battery clamps or a direct connection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine wave output",
    "explanation": "Pure sine wave inverters produce power close to what a wall outlet gives, which suits motors, CPAP machines and sensitive chargers. Modified sine wave units are cheaper and fine for simple chargers, yet some electronics run hot or buzz on them. The listing should name pure sine wave outright; if it does not, assume modified."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery drain and wiring",
    "explanation": "An inverter pulls a lot of current from a 12V battery, and 1000W works out to roughly 85 amps. Run it without the engine on and a starter battery can be flat in under an hour, while a deep-cycle battery needs the right cable gauge and a fuse near the terminal. Look for included cables and a stated low-voltage shutoff."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outlets and protections",
    "explanation": "Count the AC sockets and USB-C ports against the devices you will actually plug in. Look for overload, short circuit, over-temperature and reverse polarity protection named on the listing. A named fuse rating or a certification mark is a better sign than a generic safety badge."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can an inverter run a camping fridge?",
    "a": "Yes, if the running watts and startup surge fit under the inverter's ratings and the battery is big enough. A compressor fridge needs a surge allowance, so the BELTTT 2000W Inverter is the realistic pick here. A 200W or 300W plug-in cannot carry that startup."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with plug-in inverters?",
    "a": "Believing the 400W label applies through the cigarette socket. Most vehicle sockets are fused far lower, which is why listings like the YSOLX recommend loads under 150W. Stay under that number or wire the inverter to the battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a pure sine wave inverter worth it?",
    "a": "For sensitive electronics, motors and medical devices, yes. For phone and laptop chargers, a plug-in like the BESTEK 300W Inverter is usually enough. Pay for sine wave when a load is picky about its power."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a battery-clamp or hardwired inverter safely?",
    "a": "Use the shortest, thickest cables the listing includes, add a fuse near the battery positive terminal, and keep the inverter ventilated and dry. Connect the inverter off, then switch it on. Never run it in a closed space with a flooded battery that can vent gas."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I leave an inverter running overnight?",
    "a": "Only if the battery can afford it. Even idle inverters draw current, and a low-voltage shutoff will cut power if the battery sags. Switch it off when not in use, and keep a charger or solar input handy."
