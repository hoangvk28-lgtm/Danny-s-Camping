It doubles as a rainproof shelter sheet, a ground cover or a sunshade when you open it flat.\n\nAmong the five picks, it is the one made as a reusable outer cover for a sleeping bag, where the others are mostly thin mylar for emergencies. It weighs far less than a sleeping bag cover from a big outdoor brand, and its price is just under the cap.\n\nIt suits backpackers who need extra wet-weather protection for a down bag.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cover or emergency bag",
    "explanation": "A true bivy cover wraps a sleeping bag in a waterproof shell, while an emergency bag is a thin mylar sack meant to hold heat in a crisis. They look similar at this price yet serve different needs. Decide whether you want weather protection for camping or a safety item for a kit, and check the product title for the word emergency."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Length and width",
    "explanation": "Emergency bags range from about 78 to 84 inches long and 36 to 47 inches wide, which can be tight for large campers. A narrow bag leaves no room for a thick jacket. Measure your height plus a few inches and compare it to the stated length."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Material feel",
    "explanation": "Mylar foil is light and reflective but tears easily, while Oxford or nylon fabric resists snags. Foil also crinkles loudly and holds condensation, so a fabric shell feels less clammy at 3 a.m. Look for the fabric name in the title, and expect a shell to last several trips instead of one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Heat claims in context",
    "explanation": "Reflective bags are often said to return 90 or 95 percent of body heat, but that depends on a sealed fit and an insulating layer underneath. They are not a replacement for a sleeping bag in cold weather. Treat the percentage as a feature of the material and not a temperature rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pack count and extras",
    "explanation": "Two-packs, four-packs and kits add whistles, cord or stuff sacks, which can double as safety gear. Count the number of bags and extras against your plan, such as one per car and one per hiker. A multi-pack costs less per bag but leaves you carrying more than you need."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a bivy sack the same as a sleeping bag?",
    "a": "No. A bivy sack is a shell or emergency bag that adds weather protection and some heat retention, while a sleeping bag provides real insulation. The Ultra-Light Nylon Bivy works over a sleeping bag, and the mylar bags work only as emergency layers."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I sleep in a mylar bag overnight?",
    "a": "You can in an emergency, but condensation builds inside because the foil does not breathe. You will wake damp unless you wear dry layers and ventilate. The MADIKRI Oxford Bag helps a little with its fabric shell and zipper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stop condensation in a bivy?",
    "a": "Leave the hood or zipper partly open, keep your breath outside the bag and avoid sealing yourself in on a wet night. Condensation forms when warm air meets a cold waterproof surface. A breathable cover like the Ultra-Light Nylon Bivy still traps some moisture."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do the emergency bags come with a zipper?",
    "a": "Most do not. The MADIKRI Oxford Bag has a half zipper and a drawstring hood, while the NovaMedic, Zmoon and SURVIVE bags are simple open sacks. If you want easy entry, the zipper bag is worth the small price jump."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I repack a mylar bag?",
    "a": "Fold it along the original creases and keep it in its pouch. Do not crumple it, since sharp creases split the foil, and store it away from a knife or pointed gear. A tidy fold keeps the SURVIVE 2-Pack Kit at its 2.5 by 4 inch size."
