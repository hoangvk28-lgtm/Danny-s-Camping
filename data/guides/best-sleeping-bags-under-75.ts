export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Real temperature ratings",
    "explanation": "A sleeping bag with a 30F or 15F rating is built for colder nights, while a bag with a 50 to 70F range is a summer bag. The number in the title is often the limit, not the comfort rating. Check whether the product states both numbers, and choose a bag rated at least 10 degrees below the lowest night temperature you expect."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mummy vs rectangular cut",
    "explanation": "A mummy bag tapers to the feet and traps more heat, but it feels snug around the hips. A rectangular bag gives room to roll over and costs less, yet it leaks heat at the shoulders. If you camp near freezing, choose the mummy, and if you camp in mild weather, choose the roomier rectangle."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Length for tall campers",
    "explanation": "A bag shorter than your height compresses the insulation at the feet and lets cold in. Look for a stated length of at least 6 inches more than your height. The 75 inch Amazon Basics fits up to about 6 feet, while the 86.6 inch bags fit taller adults."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell and wet weather",
    "explanation": "A 210T ripstop polyester shell resists tears and sheds light moisture, while a nylon shell wipes clean. Neither is waterproof, so keep the bag in a tent. Look for the shell fabric and denier or thread count in the feature list, and treat a water-resistant claim as a splash guard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed volume",
    "explanation": "A cold-weather bag weighs 3 to 4 lb and fills a large stuff sack, while a summer bag can weigh 1.5 lb. Car campers can ignore weight, but backpackers cannot. Look for the packed dimensions and weight, and plan for the extra space a warmer bag takes."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 15F bag enough for winter camping?",
    "a": "It is enough for light freezing nights, not for deep winter. The Bessport Mummy Bag has a 15 to 45F range, and the real comfort point sits higher than the lowest number. For nights below 20F, add a pad with a high R-value and a liner."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does a 30F rating mean?",
    "a": "A 30F rating describes the lowest temperature where the bag still protects an average sleeper, not where you stay comfortable. The Amazon Basics 30F Bag is a cool-weather bag, so plan on using it above 40F for comfort. Add a base layer for colder nights."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a summer bag in spring?",
    "a": "Yes, with limits. The NewDoar Ultralight is rated for 50 to 70F, so it suits late spring only if nights stay above 50F. Add a liner and wear dry clothes, and move to a 30F bag if the forecast dips."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a cold-weather bag from absorbing moisture?",
    "a": "Sleep with a pad under you and keep the bag away from the tent wall, since condensation drips from the walls. Dry the bag in the sun each morning and store it loose, not compressed. Wet insulation loses much of its warmth."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a double-zip sleeping bag worth it?",
    "a": "A two-way zipper lets you open the foot end to vent heat, and some bags zip together as a double. The NewDoar Ultralight zips to a second bag, and the Bessport Mummy Bag has double SBS zippers. It is useful on warm nights and for couples."
