  {
    "criterion": "Rating vs comfort",
    "explanation": "A label lists the lowest temperature the bag is meant to survive, while comfort is the warmer figure where you sleep well. The Londtren prints both, which makes it easier to judge. Use the comfort number when you plan a night, and treat the lower figure as a limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Width and height",
    "explanation": "A roomy bag needs enough width that you can roll over without pulling the shell tight. Thirty-six to forty inches is the usual range for big and tall cuts. Check the stated fit height as well as width, since the Coleman stops at 6 ft 4 in."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cotton vs synthetic cover",
    "explanation": "A cotton cover and flannel liner feel soft and warm to the touch. They also hold moisture and dry slowly after rain or dew. Check the cover and lining material in the listing so you know how much care the bag will need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Draft control",
    "explanation": "Cold air leaks mostly along the zipper and around the neck. A draft tube behind the zipper and a drawstring hood close both gaps. Check that the listing names these features, since not every wide bag has them."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and bulk",
    "explanation": "Wide cotton bags are heavy and do not compress well. That matters if you carry the bag from a trunk to a campsite more than a few steps. Look for a printed weight or packed size, and plan trunk space if none appears."
