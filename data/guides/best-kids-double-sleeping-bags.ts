It can split into two layers, each usable as a quilt or blanket, and S-shaped stitching helps hold the fill in place.\n\nOne listed size weighs 6.2 lb and compresses to about 12.7 x 14.1 x 6.5 inches, while a lighter listing shows 5.3 lb. Compared with the OBTANIM Double, it lists clearer weight and packed-size numbers and offers the quilt-or-bag flexibility that suits warm nights.\n\nA practical choice for siblings or a parent and child who want one roomy bed at the campsite.

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature numbers for kids",
    "explanation": "Children lose heat faster than adults, so a bag labelled for adults may feel colder to them. Look for a printed comfort rating and add a warm layer. If the listing prints none, treat the bag as mild-weather only."

  {
    "criterion": "Weight and loading",
    "explanation": "A double bag can weigh 5 to 6 lb, which matters when it shares trunk space with a cooler and a tent. Printed weights vary with the size you choose. Check which size the weight belongs to before comparing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Splitting layers",
    "explanation": "A bag that splits into two layers can be a quilt for hot nights or two covers on a bed. This also lets a child use a layer alone at a sleepover. Look for the words separate layers or two bags in the listing."
