export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Why diesel",
    "explanation": "Diesel burns less fuel per kilowatt-hour than gasoline and the engines last long under steady load. It also stores better than gasoline. Diesel units cost more and weigh more, so match the machine to the stay."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watts and tank",
    "explanation": "A 12 gallon tank at 50 percent load gives about 32 hours, which can run a camp for days. A 3.5 gallon tank gives about 8 hours. Check the tank and the load used in the runtime claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outlet match",
    "explanation": "A 30 amp RV needs a twist-lock outlet and cord or an adapter. A mismatch means buying an adapter. Look at the outlet list on the listing and match your RV's plug."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide",
    "explanation": "Diesel exhaust also contains carbon monoxide. Run it outdoors at least 20 feet from tents, windows and vents, with the exhaust pointed away. Neither listing states a CO sensor."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and moving",
    "explanation": "Industrial diesels often weigh well over 100 pounds. A lifting eye or roll bar helps with hoists and trailers. Check the shipping weight before buying."

    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with diesel generators?",
    "a": "Underestimating weight and placement. Plan how you will move it, and keep it outdoors away from tents."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Energypac worth it over the Generac?",
    "a": "If you want electric start and a 30 amp twist-lock, yes. Otherwise the Generac XD5000E costs less and runs longer."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I start a diesel generator?",
    "a": "Check oil and fuel, turn the key, and let it warm. The Energypac 6KW has electric start with recoil backup."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store diesel fuel?",
    "a": "Use approved containers, keep fuel clean and use stabilizer for long storage. Cold weather can gel diesel, so use winter fuel."
