  },
  {
    "criterion": "Nose pad and temple grip",
    "explanation": "Sweat makes plastic frames slide, so rubber or silicone grip points are the main defense. Adjustable nose pads let you fit a narrow or wide nose. Check whether the listing names rubber, silicone or adjustable pads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation and anti-fog",
    "explanation": "Lenses fog when warm breath and sweat meet cold lens surfaces. Vents or an anti-fog design give air a path across the lens. Look for vent or anti-fog wording in the title and bullet points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Field of view",
    "explanation": "A wider or curved lens reduces blind spots at the edges, which matters on a road with cyclists or on a technical trail. Check the lens width in millimeters on the listing. Compare it with a pair you already wear comfortably."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UV400 and polarization",
    "explanation": "UV400 is the actual eye protection, and polarization reduces glare off wet roads and water. Some runners dislike polarization when reading a phone or watch screen. Check that the listing names UV400."
  },

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with running sunglasses?",

  {
    "q": "Is the Lamicall worth it over a budget pair?",
    "a": "If you run long distances or sweat heavily, yes. The adjustable pads and 24 g weight matter after the first hour. The suoso Wrap Around is fine for short runs."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stop sunglasses from fogging?",
