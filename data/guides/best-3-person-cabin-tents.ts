export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rated capacity vs real capacity",
    "explanation": "Brands rate a tent by how many sleeping bags fit shoulder to shoulder, with no gear. A tent rated for 4 sleeps three comfortably with room for bags. Look for a capacity figure with gear on the listing, as CORE gives."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor dimensions",
    "explanation": "An 8 by 7 foot floor is 56 square feet, and a 7.8 by 7.8 foot floor is 60.8. Three adults on pads need around 20 square feet each with packs. Compare the numbers on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Center height",
    "explanation": "A 72 inch center lets most adults stand, while 70.8 inches gives less room at the walls. Straight walls help the corners. Check the height and wall description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproofing",
    "explanation": "A 1200mm rating is a basic rain defense. Taped seams and a full rainfly are what stop leaks in sustained rain. Check for taped seams on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation",
    "explanation": "A mesh ceiling lets hot air escape, and lower vents bring cool air from the ground. A tent with one door has less cross-flow. Check the mesh count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and setup",
    "explanation": "Weight sets how far you can carry the tent from the car. Setup time of 5 to 8 minutes matters at dusk. Check the weight and the setup claim on the listing."

  },
  {
    "q": "What air mattress fits a 3-person cabin tent?",
    "a": "A queen fits in the 8 by 7 foot CORE and the Vidalido's 7.8 by 7.8 foot floor. Three adults usually need two pads or a mix. Measure the floor."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a cabin tent better than a dome for three?",
    "a": "Cabin tents give more standing room and straighter walls, and they weigh more. A dome is lighter and wind-stable. Choose by comfort over weight."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a cabin tent?",
    "a": "Lay out the footprint, assemble the poles and clip the body on. Fit the rainfly, stake corners and guy the lines. Two people shorten the job."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a cabin tent dry?",
    "a": "Stake the rainfly tight, keep it off the tent body and use the vents. Seam tape helps. Dry it before packing."
