export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Lumens vs real use",
    "explanation": "A compact flashlight at this price rarely sustains its top lumen figure for more than a few minutes. A claim of 1500 or 2800 lumens is best treated as a burst, while the low and medium modes are what you will use. Compare runtime on a mid setting rather than the highest number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zoom and focus",
    "explanation": "A zoomable head lets you spread the beam into a flood for the campsite or tighten it into a spot for a far tree line. A fixed beam only does one job. Check whether the head slides to focus, as on the RECHOO, Victoper and DARKBEAM."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery type",
    "explanation": "A rechargeable light saves buying cells but fails when the battery wears out or you forget a cable. A cell-powered light can be refilled anywhere. Look at the power source in the title or first bullet, and keep a spare set of cells in the same bag as the light so a dead light never ends the evening."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water rating",
    "explanation": "IP65 resists water jets and dust, IPX5 resists jets, and splash resistant means rain at an angle. Dunking a splash-rated light can kill it. Check the exact rating before camping near water, and treat a light with no rating as something to keep dry in a pocket before you take it near a creek or a kayak."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mode count",
    "explanation": "Five modes usually means low, medium, high, strobe and SOS. Strobe and SOS help in an emergency, but too many modes make a light awkward to use. Look for a simple mode order that starts on low or medium, and check that the mode button is large enough to press with a glove."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Body and grip",
    "explanation": "An aluminum body survives drops better than plastic and sheds heat. A knurled grip stays steady with wet hands. Check the material in the product details and a hard-anodized finish resists scratches in a gear bin, because a slick body is the one you drop in a stream and the weight when you hold it in one hand."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How many lumens do I need for camping?",
    "a": "Around 100 to 300 lumens covers tent chores and a campsite walk, and 500 to 1000 lumens is plenty for spotting far things. The DARKBEAM 2800 claims much more than you can sustain. Choose a light with a good low mode."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are zoomable flashlights worth it?",
    "a": "Yes, because one light does flood and spot, as the RECHOO 4-Pack and Victoper 2-Pack do. A zoomable head can be slightly less sealed than a fixed head. Keep it dry and check the sliding head glides smoothly before you rely on it."
  },
  {
    "q": "Rechargeable or cell-powered?",
    "a": "Rechargeable lights like the DARKBEAM 2800 save money but need a cable. A cell-powered pack like the Victoper 2-Pack can be refilled anywhere. Carry spare cells or a power bank and a light kept in a glovebox may lose charge over a summer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I trust a solar flashlight?",
    "a": "As a backup, yes. The IFTHFOUR Solar charges in 2 to 3 hours by USB and slower in the sun. Charge it fully before a trip, and use solar for emergencies and test it before every trip, since weak sun may charge it slowly."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a flashlight?",
    "a": "Remove cells from lights you will not use for months, and keep rechargeable lights at half charge. Store them dry. Check the O-ring on the RECHOO 4-Pack from time to time to avoid leaking cells in the heat of a car."
