export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What $200 buys",
    "explanation": "At this price a lithium battery of 120Ah now competes with lead-acid at 75 to 90Ah. That means you can store about 1536Wh instead of about 900Wh, with less weight. Decide whether you need cranking power before choosing, since lithium here is deep-cycle only, and note that the lithium pick here has no cranking rating at all so you can compare the two chemistries fairly."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Deep cycle vs dual-purpose",
    "explanation": "A deep cycle battery tolerates repeated deep drains, while a dual-purpose battery trades some of that for starting power. Draining a dual-purpose battery below 50 percent shortens its life. Check whether the battery lists cold cranking amps, which signals a starter, and treat those as the batteries to avoid draining deeply before you buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold cranking and reserve",
    "explanation": "Cold cranking amps (CCA) show how hard a battery can crank an engine in cold, and reserve capacity shows how many minutes it can run a 25A load. A 550 CCA battery starts most outboards up to 350 horsepower. Check CCA against your engine's requirement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger and cycle life",
    "explanation": "Lithium needs a lithium profile at about 14.4 to 14.6V, AGM needs an AGM profile and gel needs a lower gel one. A wrong profile cuts the life of any battery. Check what your charger and solar controller support and the cycle claim that sits beside it in the specifications, since lead-acid and lithium need different voltages."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and Group size",
    "explanation": "Group size, such as 24M or 27M, defines the case footprint and fits standard trays. A 90Ah lead-acid battery weighs around 55 to 65 lb, while a 120Ah lithium weighs far less. Measure your tray before you order and allow room for terminal clearance and a strap or hold-down."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Monitoring",
    "explanation": "A Bluetooth app that shows voltage, current and state of charge helps avoid draining a battery too far. It also helps find a parasitic load. Check whether the app exists for your phone, and whether it works without a subscription since some brands lock features behind an account."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a dual-purpose battery run a trolling motor?",
    "a": "Yes, but not as long as a true deep cycle of the same size. The Mighty Max MM-G24M, Banshee 27M AGM and UPLUS 24M Dual handle moderate cycling. Do not drain them below 50 percent and a lithium option is better for that duty."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will a 120Ah lithium battery run a fridge?",
    "a": "A 12V compressor fridge uses about 40 to 60 watt-hours a day in mild weather, so a 120Ah lithium holds about 1536Wh and can run one for several days. Weather and door openings change the figure. Add lights and a pump for a shorter time."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the GOKWH 120Ah worth more than the VEVOR 75Ah?",
    "a": "Yes for house use, because it stores 60 percent more and weighs far less for about the same money. It also comes with an app. Choose the VEVOR 75Ah AGM only if your charger cannot be changed."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a lithium battery work in the cold?",
    "a": "It can, but charging below freezing can damage the cells unless the battery has low-temperature protection. The GOKWH 120Ah LiFePO4 includes it. Lead-acid like the VEVOR 75Ah AGM tolerates cold charging better before relying on it."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect two batteries?",
    "a": "Wire them in parallel with matched cables of equal length, and use batteries of the same type and age. Never mix lithium and lead-acid. Fuse each battery separately so that one weak battery does not drag the other down."
