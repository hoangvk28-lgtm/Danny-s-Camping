export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the bed and cab",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cap tent or bed tent",
    "explanation": "A tent that slips over a cap opening needs a flat-back shell, and a bed tent needs an open bed. Pick the type that matches how your truck is set up today. The title usually says caps or shells if one is required."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tailgate width",
    "explanation": "The DAC states tailgates of 58 inches or less, and a wider tailgate will not seal around the opening. Measure the tailgate with a tape. Look for a width limit in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof detail",
    "explanation": "A coating number such as PU2000mm tells you how much rain the fabric resists, and a listing with no number leaves you guessing. For a tent that is your only roof, the figure matters. Look for the PU number in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "A 5 pound tent packs into a seat pocket, and a heavier one needs bed space. Small packs keep the bed free for gear. Check the packed size and what travels in the bag."

  },
  {
    "q": "What goes wrong most often?",
    "a": "Buying a full-size truck tent for a short bed. The LEIRUIYG lists a 155cm bed length, so compare it with your own. A tent too long will sag and flap."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the bed tent worth over a cap tent?",
    "a": "It is if you have no cap, since the DAC Tailgate Tent will not work without one. The LEIRUIYG costs more but gives a floor and headroom. With a cap, the DAC is simpler."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up the DAC?",
    "a": "Raise the rear window, lower the tailgate and slip the tent over the opening. Hook the shock cords to the underframe and wheel wells. No poles are needed."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for either tent?",
    "a": "Dry the fabric completely before storing it in its bag. Wipe the zippers and check the poles on the LEIRUIYG. Keep the DAC away from sharp bed edges."
