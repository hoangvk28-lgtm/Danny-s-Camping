export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What mAh actually tells you",
    "explanation": "Milliamp-hours measure how much charge a battery stores, but not how long a fan runs, because that depends on fan power. A 20000mAh battery in a low-power fan can run far longer than a 20000mAh battery in a large one. Compare the capacity against the listed runtime hours to see how efficient the fan is."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime claims and speed",
    "explanation": "A runtime like 11 to 60 hours covers the range from highest to lowest speed. The long figure is the lowest speed and the short figure is the highest, so a hot night at full power is nearer the short number. Check which speed the listing ties its longest claim to."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging time and port",
    "explanation": "A big battery takes longer to refill, and a USB-C port usually charges faster than a micro-USB. A four to six hour charge fits a day at the campsite with a power bank or solar panel. Look for the stated charge time and port type on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Power bank output",
    "explanation": "Some fans also work as a power bank for a phone, which is handy but shares the same battery. Using it for charging cuts fan runtime. Check that the listing names a USB output and its current if you plan to charge a phone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Blade size and airflow",
    "explanation": "A larger blade moves more air at the same speed, but also takes more pack space and more battery. A small 9 to 11 inch fan cools a person, while a 31 inch fan cools a canopy. Match the blade span to the space, not to the biggest number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mounting and weight",
    "explanation": "A hanging fan rests on a loop, pole or ridge line, and a heavier fan puts more load on a thin tent loop. Most small fans weigh well under a kilogram, while a 40000mAh canopy fan is much heavier. Look for the listed weight and the hook design before you hang it."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How long will a rechargeable tent fan really run?",
    "a": "The hours on a listing are best-case figures at the lowest speed. At a mid setting you will get fewer hours, and at the top speed fewer still. Plan on the shorter end of the range for hot nights."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I charge a rechargeable tent fan from a solar panel or power bank?",
    "a": "Yes, most are charged by USB cable, so a power bank or small solar panel can top them off. A larger battery takes longer, so a 40000mAh fan needs a stronger source than a 4000mAh one. Check the listed charge port and input before you rely on solar."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger battery always better?",
    "a": "No, a bigger battery adds weight, cost and charging time. A 4000mAh fan is plenty for a short weekend if you can recharge each day. Choose capacity to match the number of nights between charges."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I hang a rechargeable fan in a tent?",
    "a": "Use the built-in hook on a ceiling loop or pole, and position it so the breeze crosses your sleeping bag. A fan hung near the roof circulates warm air, and one hung low cools you directly. Keep the cord and remote clear of the zipper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I look after the battery between trips?",
    "a": "Charge it after a trip and top it up every month or two in storage, as most lithium batteries prefer partial charge. Keep it out of a hot car. Wipe the blades and grille dry before storing."
