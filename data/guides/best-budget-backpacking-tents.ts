export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weight vs price",
    "explanation": "Budget tents often skip carry weight on the listing, but a 4 lb tent and an 8 lb tent feel very different after ten miles. Weight matters most when you carry the tent yourself rather than park beside it. Look for a figure in the title, bullets or details and treat a missing figure as a reason to ask before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pole material",
    "explanation": "Fiberglass poles are cheap and heavy and flex or splinter under wind load, while aluminum poles survive harsher weather. Poles are the part of a budget tent that most often fail in the field. The bullets usually name the pole material, so look for 7001, aluminum alloy or fiberglass."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A rating such as PU3000 or 3000mm HH describes how much water pressure the fabric resists. Under about 1500mm, a rain fly leaks in steady rain, while 3000mm is a common budget target. Check the listing for the number and for taped seams, since stitching can leak even on a good fabric."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seam and floor quality",
    "explanation": "Sewn seams without tape allow water in through the needle holes. A bathtub floor, which turns up the sides, blocks splashes. Look for words such as taped seams or bathtub floor in the listing and treat silence as a sign to seam-seal at home."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real capacity",
    "explanation": "A tent labelled for two people usually fits two sleeping pads with little room for gear. Check the interior footprint in inches, since a 57 inch width is snug for two pads. If you carry packs inside, go up one size or choose a model with vestibules."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation and bugs",
    "explanation": "Double-layer doors and mesh panels reduce condensation, which soaks sleeping bags in humid weather. A single door and no vents are an easy way for a cheap tent to feel damp. Look for the number of doors and vents in the listing before buying."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a budget backpacking tent safe in rain?",
    "a": "Most are fine in light to moderate rain if the fly is tight and the seams are sealed. The Reactive 3 Second lists taped seams. For others, seam-seal the stitching yourself."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with cheap tents?",
    "a": "Buying by person count. A 2 person label often fits two thin pads only, so the Wakeman 2P suits one person with gear. Check the inches."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the BISINNA worth it over the JELUCAMP?",
    "a": "Choose the BISINNA for room and freestanding aluminum poles, and choose the JELUCAMP for a lower listed weight. The extra space matters most for shared trips. Solo hikers will rarely need it."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch a poled dome tent?",
    "a": "Lay the footprint, thread poles through the sleeves or clips, raise the frame and stake the corners before adding the fly. Guy out the fly in wind. Practice at home first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I extend the life of a cheap tent?",
    "a": "Dry it fully before storing, avoid packing it wet and brush off dirt. Use a footprint to protect the floor. Replace lost stakes with sturdier ones and seam-seal the fly if the listing does not mention taped seams."
