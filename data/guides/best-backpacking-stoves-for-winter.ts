It also fits both threaded isobutane/propane canisters and long butane tanks with the supplied adapter.\n\nA strong choice for winter backpackers and motorcycle campers who want the canister away from the flame and a rigid case.

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stove versus heater",
    "explanation": "Cooking stoves are not tent heaters. Wood hot tent stoves such as the Zarkind have chimneys and spark arrestors for that job. Never run a canister stove inside a tent, because carbon monoxide builds up fast."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind protection",
    "explanation": "Wind carries heat off the pot in winter more than in summer. A built-in windscreen net, a swirl burner or a firebox helps. Always carry a foil windscreen if the stove has none."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pot stability on snow",
    "explanation": "A stove can sink and tip on snow. A wide base or a stand rated for heavy cookware matters. Use a flat board or a pot stand under the stove."

  },
  {
    "q": "Is a hose-fed stove worth it over a pocket stove?",
    "a": "If you cook in freezing weather and want the canister away from the burner, yes. The AOTU Piezo is lighter and cheaper for mild cold. Check the canister thread on each."
