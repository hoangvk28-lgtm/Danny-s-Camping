export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 50F is for",
    "explanation": "A 50 degree rating is a summer-night number, and comfort sits warmer. It suits warm lowlands, desert nights and warm-season trips. Check forecast lows and add a liner if nights drop toward 45F."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight versus warmth",
    "explanation": "Lighter bags often carry less fill and a narrower range. A 1.5 lb bag is the right trade in summer, not in fall. Compare the printed weight with the temperature range, and trim weight only where the forecast allows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed dimensions",
    "explanation": "A bag that stuffs to 11.8 x 6.5 inches takes less pack volume than one that stuffs to 14 inches. Check whether the listing gives uncompressed or compressed size. Compression sacks help but also stress the fill over time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cut and zipper",
    "explanation": "Mummy cuts save weight, while semi-rectangular cuts add room. A J zipper or foot vent adds temperature control. Choose by how you sleep, not just by weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit height",
    "explanation": "Backpacking bags are cut tight to save weight, so a bag that is too short compresses the feet. Check the printed fit height against your own. Taller hikers should look for a long size."

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do hikers make with light bags?",
    "a": "They skip the pad. Ground cold drains more heat than the air, so a pad with a good R-value matters as much as the bag. Pair any pick here with an insulated pad."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the NewDoar worth it over the Kelty Rambler?",
    "a": "If weight matters, yes. If you want named insulation and a roomier cut, the Kelty Rambler 50 is better. The NewDoar is lighter by more than a pound."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I pack a trail bag?",
    "a": "Stuff it into the compression sack from the foot end, then tighten the straps evenly. Put it low in the pack. Keep it dry in a liner."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a backpacking bag?",
    "a": "Keep it loose in a large breathable sack at home. Long compression flattens the fill. Wash only as the tag directs, and dry it fully."
