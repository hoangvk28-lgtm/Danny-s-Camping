export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 20 degrees means",
    "explanation": "A 20 degree rating is usually the limit, which is the coldest temperature at which an average sleeper can survive a night. The comfort rating is higher. The Sierra Designs Cloud 20 gives both, a 26 degree F comfort figure and a 15 degree F limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power",
    "explanation": "Fill power measures loft per ounce, and higher numbers give more warmth for the same weight. The Sierra bag is 800, the Naturehike 650 and the Kelty 550. Compare fill power with fill weight, since more low-grade down can equal less high-grade down."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "A 20 degree down bag usually weighs between 1.8 and 3 lb. Lighter bags cost more because of finer shell fabrics. Check the printed trail weight and the fill weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zipperless or zippered",
    "explanation": "A zipperless comforter design saves weight but works differently from a standard mummy. A zippered bag is easier to enter and vent. Try both if you can."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sizing",
    "explanation": "A bag that is too short compresses the foot box and cools your feet, and a bag that is too long adds dead air. The Kelty Cosmic 20 comes in Short, Regular and Long. Match the size to your height."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 20 degree bag warm enough at 20 degrees?",
    "a": "Only barely, since 20 is the limit and not the comfort. The Sierra Designs Cloud 20 prints a comfort of 26 degrees F. Plan for the comfort figure."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does DriDown mean?",
    "a": "It is a hydrophobic treatment that helps down keep loft in damp conditions. The Sierra Designs Cloud 20 uses 800 fill DriDown. It is not waterproof."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Kelty Cosmic 20 true to its rating?",
    "a": "The listing prints an ISO limit of 21 degrees F and an extreme of -11 degrees F, so the 20 label is close to the limit. No comfort figure is printed. Plan for a cooler comfort level."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a zipper?",
    "a": "A zipper makes entry and venting easier. The Sierra Designs Cloud 20 uses a foot vent instead. Try both styles."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for a down bag?",
    "a": "Store it loose, not compressed, and wash it only when needed with a down-specific soap. Dry on low with clean tennis balls. Check the care label."
