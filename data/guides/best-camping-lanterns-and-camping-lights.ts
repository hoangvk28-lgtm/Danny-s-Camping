  },
  {
    "criterion": "Power type",
    "explanation": "Battery lanterns are simple and easy to swap, while rechargeable ones save money but need a USB charge. Small solar panels charge slowly, so treat them as a backup. Check the power type and the charging methods on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Light color and modes",
    "explanation": "Warm white is gentler on the eyes in the evening, and cool white is better for tasks like cooking. A red mode preserves night vision for late walks. Look for the color and mode list before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water resistance",
    "explanation": "An IP65 rating resists rain and spray, while a plain water-resistant claim only handles light splashes. A lantern left out in a storm needs the better rating. Check the stated rating in the specs."

    "q": "Are solar camping lanterns reliable?",
    "a": "They help as a backup, but small panels charge slowly. SAMUUN 2000 Lumens charges by USB and solar, so you can top it up either way. Charge it fully before you leave."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a rechargeable lantern better than a battery one?",
    "a": "For frequent camping, yes, since you avoid buying batteries. A battery lantern like Consciot 1000LM is easy to refresh anywhere. Carry spares for either type."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use a camping lantern safely?",
