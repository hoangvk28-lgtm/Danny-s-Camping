export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Floor size for sleepers",
    "explanation": "A 10 by 10 foot floor holds two queen air mattresses or six sleeping bags, while an 8 by 8 foot floor fits two to four people. Gear takes about a quarter of the space, so size up if you pack heavy. Compare the real dimensions rather than the person rating on the label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sleeve fit on your hatch",
    "explanation": "An elastic sleeve with adjustable straps fits a range of hatch sizes, but a measured fit seals better. Measure the width and height of your open hatch and compare them to the sleeve range. Look for compatibility notes for your vehicle type before you order, especially for crossovers and minivans."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rain rating and seams",
    "explanation": "PU2000 handles showers, PU3000 handles steady rain, and sealed or taped seams close the gap at the stitching where water enters. A rainfly that clears the mesh adds a layer of protection against wind-driven rain. Check the PU figure and the seam notes in the product details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Porch or no porch",
    "explanation": "A porch is a covered entry where boots, a cooler and a stove can sit out of the rain. It adds fabric and weight to the pack, but it keeps the door area dry and the sleeping floor clean. Look for a porch in the product description or photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Exhaust and carbon monoxide",
    "explanation": "Never run the engine with the hatch open into a closed tent, because exhaust can enter the space. Park with the exhaust pointed away from the tent and open two windows for airflow. Use a battery CO alarm any time you sleep inside the tent or vehicle."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Which of these is best for six people?",
    "a": "The UNP 10x10 Dome is rated for 4 to 6 adults and has the biggest floor. Six is snug with gear, so five is more comfortable. The 8 by 8 foot tents are better for two to four."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a taped rainfly worth it?",
    "a": "Yes, taped seams stop leaks at the stitching, which is where most tents fail first. The UNP 10x10 Dome has taped seams on its rainfly. Without taped seams, you can add seam sealer yourself, but it takes an afternoon and a dry day."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I pitch an SUV tent without the car?",
    "a": "Many can, if the sleeve is detachable. The Portal 5-Person Porch and Waterproof SUV Tent PU3000 both work standalone, so you can drive away while the tent stays up. Anchor every stake and guy line if you plan to leave it unattended."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I fit the sleeve to a small hatch?",
    "a": "Use the adjustable straps to pull the sleeve snug around the hatch opening, and overlap the rubber gasket. Add a clip or a bungee where the sleeve bows. Measure the hatch before ordering, since small openings need a tighter sleeve."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean an SUV tent?",
    "a": "Sponge the fabric with mild soap and cool water, then dry it fully before packing to prevent mildew. Avoid strong detergents that strip the PU coating, and never machine wash a tent. Store it loosely in a cool, dry place."
