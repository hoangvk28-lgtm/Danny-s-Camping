export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Running watts for a home",
    "explanation": "A fridge needs about 700W to start and 150W to run, a furnace blower 800W and a sump pump 1000W. A 3500W running unit covers essentials while a 5000W unit covers more. Total the loads and add 20 percent, so a 5000W running unit leaves room for a second fridge or a well pump."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "CO sensors",
    "explanation": "A CO shutdown sensor turns the generator off at dangerous CO levels, which helps if it is placed badly. It does not replace the rule to keep it 20 feet away from windows and doors. Look for a CO sensor or alert in the specs, and use a battery CO alarm inside."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Open frame vs inverter",
    "explanation": "An open-frame unit like the DuroMax is cheaper per watt but louder, about 70 dB or more, while an enclosed inverter like the Westinghouse runs at 52 dBA. Inverters also produce cleaner power for electronics. Choose by how close the unit will be to neighbors."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel choice",
    "explanation": "Gasoline gives the most power but goes stale in 3 to 6 months. Propane stores for years and burns cleaner but gives about 10 percent less power. Dual fuel gives you both. Check the running watts on each fuel, so write down the propane running watts on the data plate before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and wheels",
    "explanation": "A 90 to 110 lb generator needs wheels, a handle and often two people. Wheels matter on gravel and grass. Check the weight and the kit, and a unit near 100 lb needs wheels, a ramp for a truck bed and a second person to load it, so check the dry weight in the specs and plan how it will get from the truck to the pad on gravel or grass before you buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch and cords",
    "explanation": "Powering a house needs a transfer switch or an interlock installed by an electrician, never a backfeed cord. A 30A or 120/240V outlet matches the inlet. Check the outlet type before buying cords, and a 30A or 120/240V outlet only matters if the cord and inlet match the generator, so check the plug type on your inlet box before buying cords."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I power my house with one of these?",
    "a": "You can power essentials such as a fridge, lights and a furnace blower, but only through a transfer switch or interlock installed by an electrician. Never plug a generator into a wall outlet. A 5000W unit like the DuroMax XP5500HX covers many homes' essentials."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store propane for a generator?",
    "a": "Keep cylinders upright outdoors in a ventilated spot, away from heat and flames. The DuroMax XP5500HX and Westinghouse iGen5000DFc run on propane through a regulator. Never store a propane tank indoors, and replace a cylinder that is rusted or past its 12 year date."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does the CO alert matter?",
    "a": "Generators produce carbon monoxide that can drift into a home through doors and windows. A CO shutdown sensor, as on the GENMAX 6000W, turns the unit off at dangerous levels. Keep it 20 feet away and use a battery CO alarm."
  },
  {
    "q": "How loud are these generators?",
    "a": "The Westinghouse iGen5000DFc runs as low as 52 dBA, while the EFURDEN 7000W is 69 dB at 23 feet and open-frame units can be louder. A 10 dB difference sounds twice as loud. Check your area's noise rules."
  },
  {
    "q": "How often should I run a generator?",
    "a": "Run it for 10 to 15 minutes under load every month and change the oil on the maker's schedule. Stabilize the fuel before storage. A neglected carburetor is the top reason a generator fails to start."
