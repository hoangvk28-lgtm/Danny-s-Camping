  "A car power inverter can be a pocket-size plug for a laptop or a 1000W box wired to a battery, and the two are not interchangeable. This list covers both ends, so the first job is matching the connection style to what you need to run.",
  "Five inverters were compared on continuous watts, waveform claims, outlets, displays and the protections each listing names. The range runs from a 300W plug-in to a pure sine 1000W unit, which keeps the picks distinct rather than five near-identical adapters."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus peak watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts is what the inverter can supply for hours, while peak is a brief surge for startup. A listing that gives only a peak figure, like a 1200W peak, says little about running loads. Choose by the continuous rating and keep a safe margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plug-in or battery wired",
    "explanation": "A cigarette socket is usually good for around 150W, so 300W and 400W plug-ins are ceilings rather than promises. A 1000W unit must be wired to a battery with thick cables and a fuse near the terminal. Decide this first."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine wave",
    "explanation": "Pure sine output works with motors, CPAP machines and finicky electronics. Standard-wave output is fine for chargers and lights. If the listing does not say pure sine, assume it is not."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery drain and engine state",
    "explanation": "Even a modest load drains a starter battery within hours with the engine off, and a 1000W load can flatten it in minutes. Run the engine, or use a separate deep-cycle battery. Look for low-voltage shutoff on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation and fuse",
    "explanation": "Fans and metal cases carry heat away, and a named fuse protects the wiring. Do not bury the unit under bags. Never use it near flammable fumes."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Which size car inverter do I need?",
    "a": "Add up the running watts of the devices you will use together, and pick a continuous rating above that. The DrimMek 300W Inverter or BESTEK 400W Plug-In Inverter suits chargers. Choose a 1000W unit for appliances."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do people make?",
    "a": "Trusting a peak rating as a running rating. The POWERFUEL 1200W Peak Inverter lists peak watts, so treat the continuous figure as lower. Check before loading it."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is pure sine worth the extra cost?",
    "a": "For motors and medical gear, yes, like the FT feiteeng 1000W Pure Sine. For charging, the OLTEANP 1000W Inverter or a plug-in is enough. Spend on sine wave only when needed."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a 1000W unit?",
    "a": "Turn the inverter off, connect thick cables with a fuse near the battery, red to positive and black to negative, then switch on. Keep it ventilated. Disconnect with the unit off."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can it drain my battery?",
    "a": "Yes, so run the engine or use a deep-cycle battery. The LCD on the OLTEANP 1000W Inverter and the screen on the FT feiteeng 1000W Pure Sine help you watch voltage. Unplug it when finished."
