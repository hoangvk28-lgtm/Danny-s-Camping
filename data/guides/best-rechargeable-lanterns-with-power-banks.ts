export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity in mAh",
    "explanation": "A 5000mAh lantern pack holds roughly enough for one or two phone charges, while a 7500mAh pack stretches further. Every phone charge also shortens the lantern runtime. Find the number in the title or specs, not just a 'power bank' claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB output rating",
    "explanation": "A 1A port is slow, and phones may charge only a little under load. Faster ports, such as the 10W reverse charging on the Glocusent, replenish a phone far more quickly. Check the listing for output in amps or watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Input port and charge time",
    "explanation": "USB-C recharges quickly and uses a cable you probably already own, while Micro USB is older and slower. Charge time matters if you top up between meals at camp. Look for the port type and the stated hours to full."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Replaceable batteries",
    "explanation": "A lantern that accepts D-cell or AA backup keeps working when the pack is flat and no charger is near. Rechargeable-only models rely on you carrying a power bank. Check the listing for compartments and whether cells are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Light quality and modes",
    "explanation": "Warm light is easier on the eyes at night and attracts fewer insects, while cool white shows detail. A night light mode or red light lets you keep the lantern on without waking others. Look for color temperature and minimum lumen figures."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a lantern power bank charge a phone?",
    "a": "Yes, that is the stated function of each lantern here. The Glocusent 1200LM lists 10W reverse charging and the Enbrighten 650 Lumen lists a 1A port. Charging draws from the same pack that runs the light."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a lantern power bank worth it over a separate power bank?",
    "a": "It saves carrying one extra device, but a separate bank is easier to swap and recharge. For an emergency kit, a combo lantern keeps one piece to find in the dark. For heavy phone use, add a dedicated bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake when using the power bank?",
    "a": "Charging the phone with the lantern on a bright setting. That drains the pack quickly, so dim the light first. Keep the pack above a quarter charge for the light itself."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge these lanterns?",
    "a": "Use the cable in the box or a USB-C cable on the models that list that port, with a wall adapter or a power bank. The Enbrighten 650 Lumen uses Micro USB."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a lantern for emergencies?",
    "a": "Charge it to about half to full, then recharge every few months. Keep it somewhere cool and dry, and consider keeping spare D-cells with the Enbrighten 650 Lumen."
