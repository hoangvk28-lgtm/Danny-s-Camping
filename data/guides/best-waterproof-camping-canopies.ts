export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Millimeter rating",
    "explanation": "A figure such as PU9000mm shows how much water pressure a coating resists before leaking, so higher is better. Many listings skip the number and just say waterproof. Look for it in the title, the bullets or the spec table."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seam sealing",
    "explanation": "Stitch holes let water through even on a waterproof fabric, so sealed or taped seams matter as much as the coating. Without them a canopy drips along the roof lines. Check that the listing names sealed or heat-sealed seams."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric denier",
    "explanation": "Denier measures thread weight, and 400D resists wear and flex longer than 150D. Heavy fabric adds pounds to the carry. Look for the denier and for a PU or silver coating on top."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Roof slope and ponding",
    "explanation": "Flat roof panels let water sit in a sag and force seams. A steep or tensioned roof sheds it. Check roof shape and whether the poles keep the top tight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mesh vs solid walls",
    "explanation": "Mesh keeps bugs out and lets rain blow in under sideways wind. Solid walls block it. Look for removable panels if you want both."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does UPF 50+ mean waterproof?",
    "a": "No. UPF measures sun protection and says nothing about rain. A canopy needs a coating or sealed seams to keep water out. The Crown Shades and HOEYITO name both a rating and seam or coating details."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common waterproof canopy mistake?",
    "a": "Assuming mesh walls shed rain. Mesh is for bugs, so sideways rain will pass straight through. Close wall panels when weather turns."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Crown Shades worth it over a tarp?",
    "a": "For groups, yes, since the pop-up frame and sealed seams give more cover. For one or two campers, the HOEYITO tarp costs far less. Match shelter to group size."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a tarp awning in rain?",
    "a": "Pitch it with one side higher so water runs off, and stake it taut. The HOEYITO retainers and poles hold it on soft ground. Check tension after the first shower."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I prevent roof pooling?",
    "a": "Keep the canopy top tight and tilt it slightly with leg heights. Empty water pockets by pushing up from underneath. Pooling can bend a frame."
