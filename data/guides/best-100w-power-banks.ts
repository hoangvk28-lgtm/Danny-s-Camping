    "explanation": "A bank may list 100W on one port, yet the total across ports can be lower. If you plug a phone and a laptop in together, the laptop may fall under 100W. Look for a total output figure on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and laptop runtime",
    "explanation": "A 20000mAh bank holds about 74Wh and a 25000mAh bank about 92Wh, so a 60Wh laptop battery fills roughly once. Heavy use drains it faster. Do the math: watt-hours divided by your laptop's watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Required cable rating",
    "explanation": "A 100W bank needs a 100W-rated USB-C cable, and many cables are rated for 60W. A weak cable throttles the charge without warning. Check the cable rating and the listing's note."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pass-through charging",
    "explanation": "Pass-through lets the bank charge a device while it recharges, which is useful when you have one outlet. It also creates heat, so use it in a ventilated space. Check that the listing names pass-through."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Airline limits",

    "a": "Yes for most USB-C laptops, as long as the laptop accepts USB-C PD up to 100W. The INIU 25000mAh 100W lists a MacBook Pro charge example. Use a cable rated for 100W."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with 100W banks?",
    "a": "Using a 60W cable and wondering why the laptop charges slowly. Match the cable to 100W. The REWONDER 100W Retractable listing says so explicitly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 25000mAh worth it over 20000mAh?",
    "a": "For laptop use, yes, since roughly 18Wh more is a real extra charge on a phone. For phones only, 20000mAh is plenty. The Anker 25K 165W Laptop Bank adds extra ports as well."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I recharge a big bank quickly?",
    "a": "Use a 65W or larger USB-C wall charger on the bank's input port. The UGREEN Nexode 100W 20K accepts 65W input. Charge it overnight."
