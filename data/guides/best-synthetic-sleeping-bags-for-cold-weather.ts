export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Label against comfort",
    "explanation": "A -30 degree title and a 30F comfort rating describe very different nights. Read the detail lines, because titles often quote the most flattering number. Plan around the comfort figure and add a margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight of cold",
    "explanation": "The Browning's 9 lb 9 oz is the cost of its rating. Warmer bags weigh more because they hold more fill. Decide whether you carry the bag or drag it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Synthetic in frost",
    "explanation": "Breath moisture freezes in a bag in sub-freezing nights. Synthetic fill tolerates that better than down, though no bag shrugs it off completely. Air the bag out each morning."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad matters more",
    "explanation": "Cold ground pulls heat from the underside, where bag fill is crushed. A pad with a high stated R-value does more than extra fill. Check the pad before you upgrade the bag."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Room for layers",
    "explanation": "A cold sleeper wears insulation inside the bag, so a snug mummy can compress itself. The Browning's 38 inch width and the WKFAMOUT's 39 inch width give space. Check the width before you pick."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a synthetic bag good for the cold?",
    "a": "Yes, because it keeps insulating when damp, and frost is a form of damp. It is heavier than down for the same warmth."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with the WKFAMOUT?",
    "a": "They trust the title's 0 degree claim over the 30F comfort figure in the details. Plan for 30F."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Browning Denali worth it over the WKFAMOUT?",
    "a": "Only if you sleep in the deep cold. For fall and early winter from a car, the WKFAMOUT is easier to live with."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use a bag this heavy?",
    "a": "Keep it on a sled or in a vehicle, and compress it only for transport. Air it daily to dry out breath moisture."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I zip two bags together?",
    "a": "The WKFAMOUT lists side zippers that join with a second bag. Match zipper sides before you buy a pair."
