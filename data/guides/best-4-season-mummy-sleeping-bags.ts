  },
  {
    "criterion": "Down or synthetic",
    "explanation": "Down is lighter for its warmth, and synthetic fill keeps working when damp. The Clostnature uses 550-fill down, while the Bessport is synthetic. Pick based on how wet your nights run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Girth and fit",
    "explanation": "A mummy that is too snug cuts circulation, and one that is too roomy wastes heat. The Bessport prints shoulder 63, hip 50.3 and foot 33 inches. Compare those to your own measurements."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "A cold bag is heavier, so check the numbers. The Clostnature prints 3.08 lb and 15 by 7.8 inches. Where a listing gives none, factor that into your decision."

  {
    "q": "Is the Clostnature worth it over the Bessport?",
    "a": "If you want down and a printed weight, yes. It prints no rating, while the Bessport at least advertises a cold range."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I get the most from a mummy bag?",
