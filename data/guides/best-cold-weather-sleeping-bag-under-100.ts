export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What this budget buys",
    "explanation": "Under $100, cold warmth comes from synthetic fill and bulk, not premium materials. That means flannel linings, heavy cotton covers and rectangular shapes. Expect to carry the bag from the car, not on your back."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Read the comfort number",
    "explanation": "Budget bags often headline a low rating that is closer to a limit than comfort. The HiZYNICE XXL names 30°F comfort next to 0°F extreme, which is honest and useful. Look for a comfort figure on the listing before you trust any number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill weight and type",
    "explanation": "Heavier synthetic fill generally means a warmer bag. A listing that names pounds of insulation, like the 5 pounds on the Coleman Heritage, is easier to compare than one that says winter grade. If no fill is named, treat the bag as milder than its headline."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Draft tube behind the zipper",
    "explanation": "A zipper is the easiest path for heat to leave. A draft tube is a stuffed strip that blocks it. Look for a named tube, since a thin bag with a tube often beats a thick one without."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit to your height",
    "explanation": "A bag that is too long leaves cold air at the feet, and one too short pushes insulation flat. Match the listed maximum height to yours with a little room to spare. Big and tall cuts often add width too."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 20°F bag warm enough for winter?",
    "a": "A 20°F bag like the Coleman Dunnock is a fall and early winter bag, not a deep winter one. Pair it with an insulated pad and warm layers. For genuinely colder nights, step up to the Coleman Heritage."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I wash these bags?",
    "a": "Yes. The Coleman Dunnock and HiZYNICE XXL are both machine washable, and the cotton flannel liner is easy to freshen. Use a gentle cycle and cold water, then dry fully before storing."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are budget cold bags worth it over a down bag?",
    "a": "For car camping, yes. Synthetic bags like these stay warm when damp and cost a fraction of down. They only lose out on weight and packed size."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stay warm in a bag like this?",
    "a": "Use a pad with real insulation, wear dry socks, and cinch the hood. Keep the draft tube flat behind the zipper. Eat before bed, as your body generates heat from food."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why do the HiZYNICE listings look the same?",
    "a": "The same bag appears in several listings, often differing in color. Pick by the size and rating stated on the page, not the listing count. The HiZYNICE XXL is the representative option here."
