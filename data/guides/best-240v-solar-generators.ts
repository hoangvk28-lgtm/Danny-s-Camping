  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated and surge watts",
    "explanation": "A 240V motor load needs rated watts plus a surge margin. A well pump can need two to three times its running watts at startup. Compare the continuous figure and the surge figure to your appliance's label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and runtime",
    "explanation": "A 5,120Wh battery runs a 3,000W load for under two hours. Divide watt-hours by load watts. Plan the number of hours you really need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input and panel voltage",
    "explanation": "A 6,400W solar input accepts a large array, but only if panels match its voltage range and ports. Check the number of solar ports and the maximum voltage and current. A kit with panels removes the guesswork."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch and safety",

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug an RV into a 240V station?",
    "a": "Not directly, since most RV cords are 120V. Use a matching outlet on the station and the right adapter, and ask the maker."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 240V worth it over 120V?",
    "a": "Only if you own a 240V appliance. Otherwise a smaller 120V unit is cheaper and lighter."

  {
    "q": "How do I connect panels?",
    "a": "Use the solar input ports with the right cable and stay inside the voltage and watt limits. A kit with panels, like the OSCAL PowerMax 6000, removes the matching work."
