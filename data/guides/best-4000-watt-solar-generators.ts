    "explanation": "A kit with 4000W continuous can run heavy loads, while one with a 4000W surge can only start them. Check the label for rated or continuous beside the number. If only a surge figure appears, plan for the lower rated watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity",
    "explanation": "At 4000W, a 4,096Wh battery lasts a little over an hour. Divide watt-hours by load watts. Pick based on how many hours the big load truly runs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input and panels",
    "explanation": "A 4,000W solar input accepts a large array, while a 200W panel adds a trickle. Check the input range and whether panels are included. Match panel voltage to the station."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "240V and transfer switch",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Expandability",
