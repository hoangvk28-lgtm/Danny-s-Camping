export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Length versus taper",
    "explanation": "A longer mummy needs more taper to stay warm, so a 90 inch bag is not simply a bigger 80 inch one. Check both length and width, and look for a hood and draft tubes. Compare the printed numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Offset versus single-layer fill",
    "explanation": "Single-layer insulation has seams where cold passes through. Two offset layers cover those seams. Look for the words offset or double-layer on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill weight",
    "explanation": "The ounces of insulation inside tell you more than the label does. A bag with 76 oz of fill carries real loft. Look for fill weight, and treat a missing figure as a gap."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Left or right zip",
    "explanation": "A left-zip and a right-zip bag can pair into a double, while two of the same side cannot. If you plan to share, check which side you need. Look for the zip side in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad and ground cold",
    "explanation": "The ground steals heat through the bag bottom. A long bag needs a long pad. Plan an R 4 or higher pad for 0F-class bags."

  },
  {
    "q": "What do tall campers get wrong with mummy bags?",
    "a": "They buy by length and ignore width. An 86 inch mummy that is too narrow compresses the fill. Check both."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is there a milder TETON version?",
    "a": "Yes. The Celsius line also has a +20F XL version and an XXL 0 degree version. Pick by your lows and your size."
  },

    "q": "Can two bags join?",
