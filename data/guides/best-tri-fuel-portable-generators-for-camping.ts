    "criterion": "Fuel-specific output",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Starting surge",
    "explanation": "A big rooftop air conditioner draws a surge when it starts. Peak watts cover that surge, while rated watts are what you run all day. Use rated watts to size your loads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outlet panel",
    "explanation": "A large motorhome uses a 50A inlet, and a generator with a 50A outlet plugs in directly. A 30A trailer needs a TT-30R or an adapter. Read the outlet list on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide protection",
    "explanation": "A CO shutdown sensor can reduce the risk from a faulty exhaust path but does not replace placement away from sleeping areas. Large generators put out a lot of exhaust. Always run them outdoors and far from vents."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and campsite fit",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are tri fuel generators good for camping?",
    "a": "They suit large RVs and base camps more than tent sites, since they are big and loud. For a small trailer, a dual fuel inverter is a better fit. Tri fuel shines when the same unit backs up a home."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run a tri fuel generator on natural gas at a campsite?",
    "a": "Only if the site provides a gas line and you have the right hose and regulator. Most campsites do not, so gasoline and propane are the practical modes. Check the listing for the natural gas output figure."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which tri fuel generator has the best runtime?",
    "a": "The Westinghouse 14500 Tri quotes up to 19 hours on a 9.5-gallon tank. The Generac 12500 Tri-Fuel quotes 14 hours at 25% load. Runtime depends on the load, so check the percentage in the listing."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I switch fuels safely?",
    "a": "Shut the engine down, turn the fuel selector and connect the right hose. Never switch fuels while the engine is hot or running unless the manual allows it. Follow the manufacturer's guidance."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need an electrician to use a big generator at home?",
