  {
    "criterion": "Iodine versus chlorine",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Contact time",
    "explanation": "Tablets need time to work, often thirty minutes or more in clear water. Cold or cloudy water needs longer. Always follow the label, and note that the Aquatabs and Fastimals listings both state 30 minutes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dose per volume",
    "explanation": "Dose per liter or gallon decides how far a bottle goes. The Aquatabs 397mg tablet treats 4 gallons while many other tablets treat a liter. Check the dose against the container you actually carry."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "What tablets do not remove",
    "explanation": "Tablets do not remove sediment, chemicals or heavy metals. Pre-filter cloudy water through a cloth first. Treat them as a backup beside a filter, not a replacement for it."

    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with tablets?",
    "a": "They drink before the wait is over. Time the full contact period, longer in cold water. Skipping it leaves the treatment unfinished."

    "q": "Is the Fastimals 500mg NaDCC worth it over Potable Aqua?",

  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use water purification tablets?",
    "a": "Fill a clean container, add the number of tablets the label gives for the volume, and wait the stated time. Shake gently to help them dissolve. Pour a little through the cap threads so the threads are treated."
  },

    "q": "Do tablets kill everything?",
