export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Grid voltage in context",
    "explanation": "A higher voltage number such as 4200V does not mean a longer reach, since coverage depends on UV lure and placement. The voltage describes the grid that kills insects on contact. Look for the UV wavelength and the stated coverage rather than voltage alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UV wavelength",
    "explanation": "Insects are drawn to UV light in the 365 to 395nm range that the PhatroyYee lists. A lantern that does not state a UV band leaves you guessing. Look for a wavelength or a UV LED named in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Placement and coverage",
    "explanation": "A zapper works best set a few yards away from where people sit, so insects are drawn to it instead of you. Putting it right on the table pulls bugs toward your food. Place it upwind and away from the seating, and treat stated coverage as a best case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar charging expectations",
    "explanation": "A small panel gives a trickle, so a cloudy day can leave the lantern short at night. USB or USB-C gives a reliable top-up. Check the listing for both charging routes and the stated hours of runtime."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Safety around a live grid",
    "explanation": "The grid carries voltage, so keep it out of reach of children and pets and away from flammable material. Never open the grid cage or touch it while on. Look for a protective cage and read the instructions before use."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do bug zapper lanterns replace repellent?",
    "a": "They reduce insects near the lantern, not around you. Use repellent or a screen alongside them, especially for mosquitoes at dusk."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a zapper lantern safe around kids?",
    "a": "The grid carries voltage, so keep it out of reach and supervised. Choose a model with a protective cage and hang it high."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 4200V better than 500V?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. The voltage describes the kill grid, while the reach depends on UV light and placement. The PhatroyYee Zapper lists the higher figure, but the BANPESTT Lantern gives better lighting."
  },
  {
    "q": "Where should I place a zapper?",
    "a": "Place it some distance from where people sit, so insects fly to it and not to you. Keep it away from food and tents."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean the grid?",
    "a": "Switch it off, let it sit for a while and brush off debris with the supplied brush if one is included. Never touch the grid while it is on."
