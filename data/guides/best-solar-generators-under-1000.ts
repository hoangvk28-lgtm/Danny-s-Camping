export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cycle rating and years",
    "explanation": "A battery rated for 3000 cycles lasts about 8 years with weekly full cycles, while 6000 cycles lasts closer to 16. Brands usually quote the percent of capacity left at that cycle count, often 70 or 80 percent. Compare the cycle number and the capacity retained, not just the headline cycles."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous vs surge power",
    "explanation": "Continuous output is what the inverter can sustain, while surge only covers a motor starting for a second or two. A 1500W station runs a kettle or microwave, and 1800W runs a small portable heater for short stretches. Look for the continuous AC figure and treat surge as a start-up margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging speed",
    "explanation": "Fast wall charging, 37 to 50 minutes to 80 percent, turns a lunch stop into a refill, while slow charging can take 7 to 8 hours. A fast charger also needs a strong wall circuit, and a standard 15A outlet limits you to about 1440W. Check the wall input watts and the time to 80 percent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input ceiling",
    "explanation": "A 600W solar input refills 1 kWh in about 2 hours of full sun, while a 200W input needs most of 2 days. A bundle's panel is a floor, not a ceiling. Check the maximum solar input in watts and volts before buying extra panels."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UPS and surge protection",
    "explanation": "A UPS mode switches to the battery in 10ms or less, which keeps a PC or CPAP from rebooting during an outage, while slower switchover of 20 to 30ms can restart a desktop. Surge shielding adds protection from voltage spikes on a shaky campground pedestal. Look for the switchover time in milliseconds in the specs, not just the words 'backup power'."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty and support",
    "explanation": "Warranties run from 2 to 5 years, with some brands covering cells for the full term and others only the electronics. A long warranty only counts if the maker has a US support team and ships replacements promptly. Read the warranty terms, note who pays shipping on a 25 lb box, and check where returns are handled."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 1 kWh station run a refrigerator all night?",
    "a": "Yes for a standard fridge averaging 100 to 150W, which uses about 1 to 1.5 kWh a day. Any pick here covers about 7 to 9 hours of a full-size fridge. Pair it with a 200W panel to refill during the day."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between 1500W and 1800W models?",
    "a": "The inverter limit decides which appliances run. A 1500W unit like the Jackery HomePower 1000 v2 Kit handles a kettle or microwave, while 1800W units like the Anker SOLIX C1000 add a bit of headroom for a heater or a coffee maker. Tally the combined wattage of what you plan to run at once."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is it worth paying extra for expansion?",
    "a": "Only if you foresee a bigger load. The Jackery 1000 Plus v2 Kit expands to 11kWh but battery packs cost extra, so you pay twice. If your needs are fixed at about a day of power, a bare DJI Power 1000 V2 is cheaper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I connect panels?",
    "a": "Use panels whose open-circuit voltage stays within the station's input range, and connect them with the supplied cables or the maker's adapter. The Anker SOLIX C1000 accepts up to 600W. Park the panels in direct sun and avoid shade on any cell."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I leave the station plugged in all the time?",
    "a": "Most can, and the UPS-equipped units are made for it. Pass-through use keeps the battery at 100 percent, which shortens life slightly, so unplug it for storage or switch to a battery-saver mode if the app offers one."
