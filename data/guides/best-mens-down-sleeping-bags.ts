export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What makes a down bag men's",
    "explanation": "A men's bag is longer and broader at the shoulders and has more insulation at the torso. Only the NEMO is labeled men's here. For others, check the stated length and shoulder width."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Length and height",
    "explanation": "A bag too short compresses the down at your feet. Kelty lists up to 6 ft 6 for the Long. Match the size chart to your height."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shoulder width",
    "explanation": "Narrow mummies pinch broader men and drive heat loss as you shift. The SYWSKW lists 33.5 inch shoulders. Check the width on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Read the ISO figures",
    "explanation": "ISO ratings use comfort, limit and extreme numbers. Kelty prints limit and extreme, and Naturehike prints comfort and extreme. Compare like with like."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power and fill weight",
    "explanation": "Higher fill power gives more warmth per ounce, but the amount of down also matters. The NEMO uses 650, the SYWSKW 680 and the Kelty 550. Weigh fill power against your weight budget."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wet down",
    "explanation": "Down loses loft when it gets wet, and hydrophobic treatments only slow that. Keep the bag in a dry sack. A tent with good ventilation reduces condensation."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do men need a men's down bag?",
    "a": "Not strictly. A men's bag has more length and shoulder room, and a unisex long bag can work. Match the size to your height."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the mistake with down ratings?",
    "a": "Reading the extreme number as comfort. The Kelty prints limit and extreme, so plan on the bag being comfortable well above them."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the NEMO Disco Down worth it over the Kelty?",
    "a": "If you sleep on your side and want vents, yes. For taller men on a budget the Kelty costs less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep down dry?",
    "a": "Store it in a dry sack and avoid tent walls. Dry it fully before packing."
