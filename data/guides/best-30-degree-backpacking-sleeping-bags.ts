Two-way zippers allow foot venting, a mid-section cinch cord tailors the fit, and two bags zip together into a double.\n\nA reliable choice for trail-focused campers who want a name-brand down bag at a mid price.

    "criterion": "Down vs synthetic for 30F",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed size",
    "explanation": "A pack has limited space, so compressed volume matters more than width. Compare printed packed dimensions. If none is printed, assume bulk."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort range vs rating",
    "explanation": "A range such as 30 to 70F tells you the lower end. A single number may be a limit. Look for a range or comfort statement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit height",
    "explanation": "A bag that is too short leaves your feet pressed against the end and cold. A bag that is too long wastes fill and weight on empty space. Match the stated fit height to your own height before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zip-together options",
    "explanation": "Some bags are sold in left-zip and right-zip versions so a pair can join into a double. That helps couples who split gear between two packs. Check the listing for the word zip together or a side marking."

  {
    "q": "Is a 30F bag enough for backpacking in fall?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do backpackers make with a 30F bag?",
    "a": "They choose a wide bag that eats pack space and then carry it a long way. Check the packed size before buying. A bag that fits the pack makes the trip easier."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Kelty worth it over the VENTURE?",
    "a": "If you carry the bag more than a short walk, yes, because it packs smaller and names its down. If you camp near the car, the VENTURE saves money and gives more room."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a down bag?",
    "a": "Stuff it loosely into the sack from the foot end and keep it dry. A pack liner or dry bag protects it from rain. Avoid cranking the compression straps for days."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep warm in a 30F bag?",
    "a": "Use an insulated pad, a hat and dry socks. Close the draft collar and cinch the hood. Eat a snack before bed."
