export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Where the range starts",
    "explanation": "A design range such as 32 to 59F tells you the coldest night the bag handles with layers. Two sleepers add heat, though a double leaks more air than a single. Treat the low end as your limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shared width",
    "explanation": "A queen-size bag measures about 59 to 62 inches across. Narrower bags compress insulation as two bodies press together. Check the stated width, not just the word double."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit height",
    "explanation": "Doubles list a maximum height, such as 5 ft 11 in. A taller partner pushes against the foot and loses warmth. Compare fit height with the taller sleeper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Splitting zippers",
    "explanation": "Zippers on both sides let you split a double into two singles or open it into a quilt. That helps on solo trips and warm nights. Check the listing for left and right zippers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight",
    "explanation": "A double often weighs 10 lb or more. Plan vehicle space and storage accordingly. Look for a printed weight, and assume heavy if none appears."

    "q": "Is a 30F double warm enough at freezing?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do couples make with doubles?",
    "a": "They pick a bag that is too narrow for two adults and then compress the insulation at the shoulders. They also forget the pad. Check the width and pad size together."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the AGEMORE worth it over the VENTURE?",
    "a": "If you want a splitting design and taller fit, yes. If you want the lowest cost and the exact 30F range, the VENTURE is fine."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a double bag at camp?",
    "a": "Lay a wide pad down first, spread the bag over it and zip both sides. Fluff the insulation before bed. Make sure the tent floor is wider than the bag."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wash a flannel double?",
    "a": "Use a large machine on a gentle cycle with mild detergent. Dry thoroughly before storing, because damp flannel mildews. Skip bleach."
