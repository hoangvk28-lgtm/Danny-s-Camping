  {
    "criterion": "Fuel type",
    "explanation": "Propane lights with a knob and controls heat precisely, while charcoal is cheaper and adds smoky flavor. Charcoal takes time to light and leaves ash to carry out. Check which fuel the listing names before buying."

  {
    "criterion": "Burner count and BTU",
    "explanation": "Multiple burners let you sear on one side and keep food warm on the other. BTU measures heat output, and totals of 16,000 to 20,000 are typical for portable grills. Look for burner count and total BTU on the product page."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stand or tabletop",

  {
    "q": "Do I need a table for a portable grill?",

  },
  {
    "q": "How do I light a propane grill safely?",
    "a": "Open the lid, check the hose connection, turn the valve and press the ignition. Light with the lid open to avoid gas buildup. Always grill outdoors on level ground."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean a portable grill?",
    "a": "Scrape the grates while they are warm, then wipe with a damp cloth after cooling. Empty charcoal ash only when fully cold. Dry the grill before storing."
