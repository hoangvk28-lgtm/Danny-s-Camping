export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match the tent floor",
    "explanation": "A footprint should be slightly smaller than your tent floor on every side, so rain does not run along the edge and collect under the tent. Most tents list a floor size in the specs, such as 84 by 54 inches for a two-person model. Measure your floor, then pick a sheet that is two to three inches smaller each way."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "PU ratings in millimeters show how much water pressure the coating resists. A 2000 millimeter rating handles light rain, and 3000 millimeters handles a long wet night better. Look for the number in the title or specs, and expect cheaper sheets to leave it off."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric type",
    "explanation": "210D Oxford is a tougher weave than 190T or 210T polyester, which are thinner but lighter. Heavier fabric lasts longer on rough ground. Look for ripstop or reinforced edges if you camp on rocky sites. Rocky or rooty campsites punish thin fabric fastest, so spend a little more there."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed weight",
    "explanation": "Footprints range from about 0.3 to 1.4 pounds. For backpacking, every ounce counts, and a lighter sheet may need more care on rough ground. Check the stated weight and pack size, and compare them to your pack space. A sheet under half a pound disappears in a pack, while a larger one is easier to leave in the car."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Anchoring points",
    "explanation": "Corner straps, grommets and rope holes let you stake the footprint so it does not shift when you set up the tent. Without them, you rely on the tent floor to hold it. Look for four or more attachment points. Spend a minute clearing sticks and stones from the spot before you lay the sheet down, since that protects the fabric more than any spec."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a footprint under my tent?",
    "a": "A footprint protects the tent floor from abrasion and adds a moisture barrier, which extends the life of a tent. It is optional, but it costs much less than a replacement tent. The Hikeman 83x55 gives that protection under $20."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should the footprint be bigger or smaller than the tent?",
    "a": "Smaller. If the footprint sticks out past the tent edge, rain runs onto it and flows under your floor. Fold any extra edge under the tent, or choose a sheet two to three inches smaller on every side. The YERGOFE 210x150 suits wider two-person floors."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a tarp instead of a footprint?",
    "a": "Yes, a cut poly tarp works, but it is heavier and may not match your tent shape. A footprint is lighter and sized for tents. The Frelaxy 33x80 weighs only 0.36 pounds. Cutting a tarp to shape also leaves ragged edges that fray, so a factory-cut footprint is neater."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean a footprint?",
    "a": "Brush off dirt, wipe with a damp cloth and let it dry fully in the shade before packing. Avoid hot dryers and strong detergents that can damage the coating. Store it loosely folded in its pouch."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which side goes up?",
    "a": "Most footprints work either way, but coated sheets should place the coating side up or down depending on the maker. When unsure, put the shiny coated side facing the tent floor. Check the product notes, since the OneTigris style sheets specify this. Staying consistent from trip to trip also keeps one face cleaner, which makes packing easier."
