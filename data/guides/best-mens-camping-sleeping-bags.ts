export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What men's bags actually change",
    "explanation": "On most listings the men's label means a roomier cut, not a different insulation. That shows up as 32 to 35 inches at the shoulders and 85 to 90 inches in length. Check the printed dimensions, because the word men's alone tells you little."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit by height",
    "explanation": "A bag that fits up to 6 ft leaves a taller camper with cold feet pressed against the end. Look for the stated fit height, and add 6 to 8 inches for comfort. Treat a missing height as a reason to measure the bag."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill weight versus rating",
    "explanation": "A fill weight such as 3.5 lb tells you how much insulation is inside, but not what temperature it handles. A bag labelled comfortable at 59F is a warm-night bag. Look for comfort and limit figures, and accept that budget bags often print only one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zipper and vent design",
    "explanation": "A double pull zipper opens from inside or outside, and a bottom zipper vents the feet. Both matter more on a boxy bag where heat can build. Check the listing for zipper layout before assuming it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad and ground cold",
    "explanation": "Ground cold cancels a bag's insulation fast. A thin pad under a budget bag often costs more warmth than a cheaper bag loses. Plan a pad with R-value 2 or higher for cool nights."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is there a real difference in men's sleeping bags?",
    "a": "Mostly in cut. Men's bags tend to be longer and wider, while insulation is similar. Compare printed dimensions instead of the label."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do men get wrong buying a bag?",
    "a": "They buy by the label and skip the fit height. A bag that fits to 6 ft is short for a 6 ft 3 in camper. Match the stated height to yours."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the MEREZA better than the Kanyak?",
    "a": "On printed detail, yes. The MEREZA XL Mens lists size, fill weight and a comfort figure. The Kanyak Single lists none of them."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use these in cold weather?",
    "a": "Neither prints a cold limit. The MEREZA XL Mens lists comfort at 59F, so use it for warm nights. Add a liner and pad for cooler camps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store them?",
    "a": "Keep them loose in a large bag, not compressed. Wash only if the tag allows. Air them out after damp trips."
