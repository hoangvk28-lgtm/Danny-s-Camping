  {
    "criterion": "Cost per year",
    "explanation": "A $51 system with a $36 two-year filter costs about $18 per year to run, while a $70 system with a one-year filter costs more. Divide the replacement filter price by its rated years to compare. Look for the replacement model and price before you buy, and add the system price spread over five years."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certification wording",
    "explanation": "IAPMO and NSF both test filters, and a filter listed to NSF/ANSI 42 or 372 meets those specific standards for taste or lead-free materials. Marketing terms like NSF-compliant or independently tested can mean much less than a listed standard. Look for the exact standard number and the testing body named in the description, and be wary of a filter that gives neither."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PFAS and lead claims",
    "explanation": "PFAS and lead are reduced by carbon and ion-exchange media, but the claim only matters if a standard covers it, such as NSF/ANSI 53 or 58. A filter that says reduces PFAS without a standard is a weaker claim. Look for the standard next to each contaminant."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "TDS and minerals",
    "explanation": "Carbon filters keep beneficial minerals like calcium and magnesium, and they do not lower TDS, the total dissolved solids that cause a flat or salty taste in hard water. A filter that leaves minerals in suits drinking water, while one that removes them suits a different goal. Look for the words does not reduce TDS or retains minerals in the product notes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Water line type",
    "explanation": "Under-sink filters need a cold water line and a faucet with a 3/8 or 1/2 inch connection, and hot lines or very low pressure cause leaks or poor flow. In a van or cabin, confirm that the line comes from a pressurized pump or city supply. Look for the connection size and a minimum pressure rating, and check your line before you order."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How long does an under-sink filter really last?",
    "a": "The rated life assumes municipal water and a steady use of about 10 gallons a day. In a cabin used on weekends, a two-year filter can last longer, and sandy water shortens it. Change it on the sooner of the gallon or time rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is PFAS reduction real?",
    "a": "A filter can reduce PFAS if it uses the right media and is tested to a standard that covers it. The Waterdrop 15UA, CuZn UC-100 and CuZn UC-150 all state PFAS reduction in their bullets. Look for the standard number, not only the claim."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a plumber to install it?",
    "a": "Usually not. The CuZn UC-100 and Waterdrop 15UA install inline on a 3/8 inch cold line in about 3 to 10 minutes with the parts included. Shut off the water, cut the line and push in the fittings."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these filters remove minerals?",
    "a": "No. The CuZn models and others here keep beneficial minerals and do not reduce TDS, so they target chlorine, lead and PFAS instead. For hard-water scale you need a softener or a different filter, and a scale-reducing hose filter handles the RV side of the job."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do I do when I leave for months?",
    "a": "Shut off the water supply to the filter and turn off the line before a long trip. Drain the filter in freezing weather so it does not crack. Flush it for a few minutes when you come back."
