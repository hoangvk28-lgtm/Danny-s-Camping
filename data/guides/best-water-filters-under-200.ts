export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Flow rate",
    "explanation": "A flow of 0.5 gallons per minute fills a pitcher in about 15 seconds, while a slower filter takes several times longer. Flow matters if you cook and fill bottles often. Look for the gallons-per-minute figure in the title or bullets, and compare it across systems."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Filter change schedule",
    "explanation": "A 6-month filter needs two changes a year, while a 5-year system needs one, so over five years the 6-month design uses ten cartridges and the long-life design uses one. Each change costs money and a few minutes of work. Look for the schedule and the cost of a replacement set, then calculate the yearly cost before you commit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Contaminant list and standard",
    "explanation": "Lists of 78 contaminants reflect testing against more substances than lists of 58, and the standard behind each claim matters more than the count. A claim backed by NSF/ANSI 53 or 58 is stronger than a generic reduces claim in a bullet point. Look for the standard and the contaminants it covers, and check that lead and PFAS are named if they matter to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dedicated faucet",
    "explanation": "A dedicated faucet keeps filtered water separate from the main tap, but it needs a spare hole in the counter or sink. Many sinks have a soap dispenser hole that works, and some do not have any hole at all. Look for the faucet in the box and its finish, and check your sink for a spare hole before you order."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Total cost of ownership",
    "explanation": "Add the system price and five years of filters to compare real cost. A $155 system with $60 in yearly filters costs about $455 over five years, while a $150 system with one 5-year filter costs about the same as its sticker price. Look for the replacement price and schedule in the product details before you decide."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is the Aquasana worth $44 more than the AO Smith?",
    "a": "If flow rate and a six-month change cycle suit you, yes. The Aquasana Claryum flows 0.5 gallons per minute, and the AO Smith AO-US-200 costs $44 less with the same 78 contaminant list. For a household that fills many bottles, the speed is the difference."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long do the filters last?",
    "a": "The Aquasana Claryum needs a new filter every 6 months or 600 gallons, whichever comes first. The CuZn UC-200 is rated for 5 years, so it needs a change about once. Replace on the sooner of the gallons or the time rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use these in a camper or tiny home?",
    "a": "Yes, with a pressurized cold line and a 3/8 inch connection. The CuZn UC-200 installs inline without drilling, which suits a camper or tiny home. Protect the filter from freezing and make sure the line is not fed from a hot source."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does NSF certification mean?",
    "a": "It means the product was tested to a standard, such as NSF/ANSI 42 for chlorine taste and odor. A full-system listing covers the entire unit and not only the media. The AO Smith AO-US-200 states 42, 43 and 401, which is a broad claim."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these filters need a plumber?",
    "a": "Not usually. Most connect with push-fit or threaded fittings to a 3/8 inch cold line, and instructions are included. Turn off the water, cut the line and flush the system for several minutes before drinking."
