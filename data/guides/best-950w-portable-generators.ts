  {
    "criterion": "What 950 watts can run",
    "explanation": "950 watts covers lights, a fan, a phone and laptop charger and a small slow cooker, but not a microwave or a camper's air conditioner. Add your loads before you buy. Look for the rated watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated versus starting watts",
    "explanation": "Starting watts last a moment, and rated watts are the continuous limit. A listing with two sets of figures can confuse this. Look for the lowest consistent rated figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mixed fuel",
    "explanation": "Two-stroke engines need oil in the gasoline at the stated ratio. Use fresh fuel and the right mix, and do not use ethanol-heavy blends for long storage. Check the ratio in the manual."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide",
    "explanation": "Neither listing mentions a CO sensor. Run the unit outdoors at least 20 feet from tents and vents, exhaust pointing away. Never run a generator inside a tent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Clean power",
    "explanation": "Basic generators produce less clean power than inverter models. Use a surge protector with laptops and Medical devices should not run on a basic generator unless the device maker approves it. Look for inverter wording on the listing."
