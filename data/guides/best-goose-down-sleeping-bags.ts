export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Which bird the fill came from",
    "explanation": "Goose down is usually valued for its loft, and duck down is the common budget alternative. The name matters because it hints at the quality bracket you are paying for. Look for the words goose down in the bullet points rather than just down in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power",
    "explanation": "Fill power is a loft measure, where a higher number means more warmth for the same weight. It tells you how efficiently the down traps air, which is why two bags with the same temperature rating can weigh quite differently. Check whether a number is printed, and treat a missing one as unknown rather than average."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature range versus rating",
    "explanation": "A single degree figure in a title is a marketing label, while a printed range such as -13 to 23 degrees F shows the spread from limit to comfort. Sleeping at the bottom of the range usually means being cold but safe. Plan around the upper figure if you want to sleep comfortably."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shape and shoulder room",
    "explanation": "A mummy bag narrows toward the feet to cut dead air, and a rectangular bag stays roomy and opens flat. The tighter shape keeps you warmer, while the roomy shape suits restless sleepers and zip-together pairs. Pick the shape you will actually sleep in, because a bag that feels cramped gets slept in badly."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell and moisture",
    "explanation": "Down loses loft when it gets wet, so a water-resistant or DWR-treated shell matters. It protects against condensation and light splashes, not heavy rain or a wet tent floor. Read the shell fabric line and keep the bag in a dry sack during the day."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is every bag here really goose down?",
    "a": "No. Only the AKMAX Goose Down Mummy names goose down. The two OMVMO bags say down in the title without naming the bird."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I wash a down bag at home?",
    "a": "Check the care label, then use a front-loading machine on a gentle cycle with a down-specific soap. Dry it on low heat with clean tennis balls to break up clumps. Never store it compressed long term, since that flattens the loft."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a mummy bag always warmer than a rectangular one?",
    "a": "Usually yes, because the narrower cut leaves less air to warm up. The OMVMO bags make up some of the gap with draft tubes at the shoulder and along the zipper. A rectangular bag is still the better pick if you cannot sleep in a snug cut."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a down bag between trips?",
    "a": "Keep it uncompressed in a large breathable sack or hanging in a closet. Compressing it for months can damage the loft. Use the small stuff sack only for travel."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a liner or a pad under a down bag?",
    "a": "Yes, a pad matters more than the bag in cold weather. The down underneath you gets crushed flat and gives almost no insulation. A closed-cell or insulated pad blocks the heat lost into the ground."
