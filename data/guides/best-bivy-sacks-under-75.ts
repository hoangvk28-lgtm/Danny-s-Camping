export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Seam construction",
    "explanation": "Seams are where a waterproof fabric leaks, because each stitch makes a tiny hole. Heat-sealed or taped seams close those holes. Look for the words sealed, taped or double-stitched in the title or specs, and treat their absence as a reason to carry a tarp."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof ratings",
    "explanation": "A PU rating in millimeters, such as PU5000 for a rainfly and PU8000 for a floor, shows how much water pressure the fabric resists. Floors need higher numbers because your weight presses water through. Look for both numbers, and accept lower numbers only if you will use a tarp."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Breathability",
    "explanation": "A fully waterproof shell traps body moisture and makes your bag damp by morning. Breathable membranes, vents and Tyvek let vapor out. Look for moisture-vapor permeable or breathable in the description. Fabric that only says waterproof is usually sealed and will leave you damp by morning on a cold night."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight versus shelter",
    "explanation": "A bivy cover can weigh under a pound, while a bivy tent runs about 3 pounds and offers headroom. If you hike far, every ounce counts. Decide whether you need a place to sit up and change clothes, because that headroom is what the extra 2 pounds buys, and use the shell for everything else."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bag fit",
    "explanation": "A bivy must fit your sleeping bag and pad without squeezing the insulation. Check the stated length and width against your bag's packed dimensions. A modular bag needs a larger shell than a slim mummy bag, so measure the stuffed width of your bag before you order."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What is a modular sleep system?",
    "a": "It is a layered military sleeping bag set that includes a patrol bag, an intermediate cold-weather bag and a bivy cover. The Military Modular Bivy is built as the outer cover for that system. It also works with standard bags that fit inside, as long as the bag and pad together are not wider than the shell. Measure your stuffed bag before you order."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bivy tent warmer than a regular tent?",
    "a": "A bivy tent has a small interior, so your body heat warms it faster than a large tent. The GEERTOP Bivy Tent has a mesh panel that you can open for airflow. It is not insulated, so you still need a proper sleeping bag."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a ground sheet under a bivy?",
    "a": "A ground sheet protects the floor from wet grass and abrasion, and it extends the life of a thin bivy. A cheap tarp or Tyvek sheet is enough. The Military Modular Bivy is most vulnerable on rough ground."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I reduce condensation in a bivy?",
    "a": "Open vents, leave the hood loose and avoid exhaling inside the bag. Pitching in a breezy spot helps. A mesh panel like the one on the GEERTOP Bivy Tent lets damp air escape, so leave it open unless rain is blowing sideways."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I clean and store a bivy?",
    "a": "Wipe off dirt with a damp cloth, let it dry fully and store it loosely folded. Avoid heat and solvents that can damage seam tape. Check seams once a season for peeling, and replace seam tape if you see a lifting edge. A small repair kit makes the shell last years longer."
