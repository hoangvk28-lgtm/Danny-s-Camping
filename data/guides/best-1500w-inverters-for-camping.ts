  "A 1500W inverter sits in the sweet spot for a camp battery bank: enough to run a small microwave, a blender or a laptop-and-lights setup, without the cable thickness a 3000W unit demands. The catch with this size is that it draws roughly 125A from a 12V battery at full load, so it belongs on thick cables clamped or bolted to the battery, never in a cigarette-lighter socket.",
  "Five 1500W models are compared here, three pure sine wave and two modified sine wave. Each was judged on the wave type it states, how many outlets and USB ports it offers, whether a remote or display is included, and which protections the listing names."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus peak watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are what the inverter can supply for hours, while peak is a brief surge for startup. A 1500W unit with 3000W peak can start a small appliance with an inrush spike but cannot run 3000W steadily. Check that your total running load stays below the continuous rating with at least 20 percent margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure versus modified sine",
    "explanation": "Pure sine wave matches household power and suits chargers with power bricks, small TVs and motor loads. Modified sine is a stepped approximation that works for simple heaters, lights and chargers but can cause buzzing or heat in sensitive gear. The listing states the type, so read it before you buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery cable and fusing",
    "explanation": "At 1500W a 12V system draws about 125A, which needs thick cable and a fuse near the battery. A thin cable gets hot and drops voltage, which can trip low-voltage shutoff early. Look for the recommended cable gauge in the manual and match it to the length of your run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cigarette socket limits",
    "explanation": "A vehicle 12V socket is typically fused around 10A to 15A, which is about 150W, so a 1500W inverter cannot run from it. Wire it to a battery with clamps or bolts, and use the socket only for small adapters. Check the box contents for battery cables before assuming you can use it right away."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery drain and chemistry",
    "explanation": "Running a 1500W load drains a 100Ah battery in well under an hour, so battery capacity matters as much as the inverter. Lithium packs with a BMS handle high draw better than small lead-acid batteries, which sag under load. Confirm that your battery can deliver the amps the inverter will pull."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation and placement",
    "explanation": "Inverters shed heat and often run a cooling fan, so they need airflow and a dry spot away from the tent floor. Never cover the vents or place the unit where it can get wet. Check the listing for the operating temperature and fan behavior."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 1500W inverter run from my cigarette lighter?",
    "a": "No. A vehicle 12V socket is usually limited to roughly 150W, while 1500W draws about 125A. Connect the inverter to a battery with proper cables and a fuse, and keep the socket for small adapters only."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake with a 1500W inverter?",
    "a": "Using thin cables. Undersized wire overheats and drops voltage, which causes false low-battery alarms. Use the gauge the manual recommends and keep the run as short as you can."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is pure sine worth it over modified sine at 1500W?",
    "a": "If you charge laptops, camera batteries or run any motor, yes. The Vehicle LCD 1500W and Cantonape 1500W are fine for simple loads, but pure sine models like the LCD Remote 1500W protect more sensitive devices."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set one up at camp?",
    "a": "Place it near the battery, connect the cables with the fuse in line, and tighten the terminals. Turn the inverter off before attaching loads, then switch on and plug in your devices."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will my battery last with a 1500W inverter?",
    "a": "A 100Ah battery gives about 1200Wh nominal, so a 1000W load runs for roughly an hour at best. Smaller loads stretch that out, so size the battery to the devices you actually run."
