export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decibel figures on a listing",
    "explanation": "A decibel number describes how loud a fan is at a stated speed and distance, and it is usually measured at the lowest setting. A 30 dB fan sounds like a whisper, while 60 dB is closer to conversation. Look for the figure and for which speed it applies to, since the high-speed noise is rarely listed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "RPM and blade count",
    "explanation": "Fewer rotations per minute usually means less blade noise, and more blades at slow RPM give a smoother breeze. A fan listing 330 RPM will sound very different from one at 3950 r/min. Check the RPM figure, not just the quiet claim in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Corded versus battery",
    "explanation": "A battery fan has a motor that works to deliver high airflow, which can hum on high speed. A corded fan runs steady and can be slow without worrying about runtime. Pick based on whether your site has USB power overnight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote and timer",
    "explanation": "The quietest moment is the one you do not have to get up for. A remote lets you drop the speed from your bag, and a timer ends the fan when you are asleep. Look for timers and a remote listed on the product page."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mounting and vibration",
    "explanation": "A fan that rattles against a pole is louder than the decibel claim, so how it mounts matters. Non-slip pads, a hook and a stable base reduce rattle. Look for those details and hang the fan clear of the tent walls."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What decibel level counts as quiet for a tent fan?",
    "a": "Under about 40 dB is whisper-quiet, and anything near 60 dB is roughly conversation level. The FRIZCOL lists under 30 dB and the Roodike lists 36 dB. Check which speed the number applies to."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are quiet fans weaker?",
    "a": "Usually, yes, at the same size. Low RPM means less airflow. The Roodike runs at 330 RPM for soft air, while the FRIZCOL can spin faster for more breeze at the cost of noise."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a corded fan worth it over a battery fan?",
    "a": "If you have USB power all night, yes. The Roodike has no battery to run flat and its cord is 13.2 ft. A battery fan is the better choice for walk-in sites."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stop a fan rattling in a tent?",
    "a": "Hang it clear of fabric, use the non-slip pads or a flat hook, and avoid hanging it on a flexing pole. A loose hook can add more noise than the motor. Test it on low speed before you sleep."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a lantern light change how loud a fan is?",
    "a": "No, but sharing a battery shortens runtime. The Gaiatop runs its lantern from the same cell, giving 5 to 17 hours depending on use. Turn off the light at bedtime if you want maximum airflow time."
