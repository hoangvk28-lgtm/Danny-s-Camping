The catch is that the plug shape and the running watts decide what actually works, and not every unit that says 30A can run a full-size air conditioner.",
  "Each generator was compared on stated running and peak watts, outlet type, CO and low-oil protection, runtime, weight and fuel tank size. The list leans toward units whose listings name a TT-30R RV outlet, and flags the one that lists an L5-30R twist-lock instead."

    "explanation": "A 30 amp outlet at 120 volts can deliver 3600 watts, but a generator must produce that. A 13,500 BTU RV air conditioner often needs about 1500 to 2000 running watts and more at start. Look for the running watts on the listing and add up your loads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "TT-30R versus L5-30R",
    "explanation": "The RV standard is TT-30R, which matches a travel trailer cord. L5-30R is a twist-lock used on some generators and needs an adapter. Check the outlet name on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide",
    "explanation": "Generators make carbon monoxide that can kill. Keep the unit outdoors, at least 20 feet from tents, windows and vents, with the exhaust pointed away. A CO sensor adds protection but never replaces distance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Start versus running watts",
    "explanation": "Peak watts cover the brief surge at start, and running watts are what the unit holds. A trailer air conditioner can need two to three times its running draw at start. Compare the running figure to your largest load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel and runtime",
