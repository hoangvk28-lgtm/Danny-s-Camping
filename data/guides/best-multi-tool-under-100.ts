export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What $100 buys",
    "explanation": "A name-brand multi-tool such as the Gerber Suspension NXT sits well under $100, and value kits sit far under it. Spending more usually buys better steel, tighter tolerances and a warranty. Compare the price against the build details on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Locks on every tool",
    "explanation": "A tool that folds shut during use can cut fingers. Look for self-locking or side-lock wording on the listing, and note when the pliers heads are excluded. A tool with locks on the blade and drivers is safer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated steel",
    "explanation": "A named steel such as 440A tells you something about edge hardness, while a plain stainless claim does not. Name-brand listings usually state the steel. Look for a grade in the bullet points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size and weight",
    "explanation": "A tool that is too heavy stays in the drawer. Closed length near 4 inches and weight near 6 oz suit a pocket, while 0.66 lbs suits a belt. Look for closed length and weight in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tool count vs usefulness",
    "explanation": "A 21-in-1 sounds better than a 15-in-1, but extra tools are often small or redundant. Pliers, a knife, screwdrivers and wire cutters do most of the work. Count the useful tools, not the headline number."

  },
  {
    "q": "Is a name brand worth it over a value kit?",

    "q": "How do I use a locking multi-tool safely?",
