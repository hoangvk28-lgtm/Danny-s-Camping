export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 240V actually means here",
    "explanation": "A standard portable station outputs 120V, the same as a household wall socket. 240V is the higher voltage used by dryers, well pumps and some RV air conditioners. Check that the listing says 240V output explicitly, not just a big wattage number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pairing versus built-in",
    "explanation": "Some stations reach 240V only when two identical units are linked, which doubles the price and the weight. Others switch internally. Read the listing for words like parallel, pair or switch to see which one you are buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and runtime math",
    "explanation": "Runtime in hours is roughly watt-hours divided by the load in watts, minus losses. A 3,000W 240V load drains a 3,000Wh unit in well under an hour. Match the capacity to how long the heavy appliance actually runs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wiring and transfer switch",
    "explanation": "Feeding a house or RV panel from a station needs an approved transfer switch or inlet, and often an electrician. Do not backfeed a panel through a normal outlet. The listing should name the compatible connection or accessory."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chemistry and charging limits",
    "explanation": "LFP (LiFePO4) cells last for thousands of cycles and tolerate heat better than older chemistries. Charging below freezing can damage cells, so check the listed operating temperature. Look for a battery management system mentioned in the specs."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need two units to get 240V?",
    "a": "It depends on the model. The GROWATT HELIOS 3600 and Anker SOLIX F3000 list 240V when two units are paired, while the BLUETTI Apex 300 lists switching to 240V through the app or onboard controls."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a 240V RV into one of these?",
    "a": "Only if the unit and the connection are made for it. Check the plug type and amperage on the RV cord against the station's outlets, and ask the maker about the right adapter or transfer inlet."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 240V worth it over a 120V station?",
    "a": "It is worth it only if you own a 240V appliance such as a dryer, well pump or large air conditioner. For fridges, lights and electronics, a 120V station is simpler and cheaper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a pair for 240V?",
    "a": "Follow the maker's parallel kit and cable instructions, using matching units and firmware. Never improvise cables, because mismatched hookups can damage the batteries or create a shock hazard."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store these between trips?",
    "a": "Keep them indoors at a partial charge in a dry place away from heat. Top up every few months, and keep the vents clear when charging."
