export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Warm only",
    "explanation": "Both picks are summer bags, with ranges of 55 to 60F and 59 to 77F. Plan your tour for warm months, or pair the bag with layers. Read the temperature on the product page rather than the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight versus volume",
    "explanation": "Motorcycle luggage usually runs out of space before weight. The ECOOPRO compresses to 11 inches in height, a number you can compare to your bag. Where no pack size is listed, measure after the bag arrives and before you commit to the trip."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell and dew",
    "explanation": "Overnight dew and road spray wet gear. A nylon shell sheds light moisture. Do not treat it as protection from a rainstorm, and keep the bag in a dry bag on the bike."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Width and fit",
    "explanation": "Narrow bags pack smaller but restrict movement. The ECOOPRO is 30 inches wide and the JEAOUIA 31.5 inches wide. Check the listing for the maximum height, which is 5 ft 11 in for the JEAOUIA."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zippers and venting",
    "explanation": "A foot zipper lets you vent heat on warm nights. A snagging zipper wastes time at camp. Look for the zipper type in the feature list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Add a liner",
    "explanation": "A liner adds a few degrees and keeps the bag clean on long tours. It takes a bit of space. Decide whether the added warmth beats the added volume for your route."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can any sleeping bag work for motorcycle camping?",
    "a": "Any bag fits if you have room, but warm-weather envelopes pack smaller. The ECOOPRO compresses to 11 inches in height."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do riders overlook?",
    "a": "The cold start and finish of the day. Both picks list ranges that begin at 55 or 59F, so bring layers."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the ECOOPRO worth it over the JEAOUIA?",
    "a": "If you need weight and pack size printed, yes. The JEAOUIA lists no weight but adds width and a foot zipper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack the bag on a bike?",
    "a": "Compress it in the sack, put it in a dry bag and strap it low to the frame. Pack it last so it can be pulled out first at camp."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I wash these bags?",
    "a": "Check the care label that comes with the bag. Wipe-clean shells help with light dirt, and a full wash should be gentle and dried fully."
