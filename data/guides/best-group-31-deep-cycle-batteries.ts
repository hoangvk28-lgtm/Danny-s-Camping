export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Starting versus deep cycle",
    "explanation": "A starting battery is built to deliver a burst of current, while a deep cycle battery is built to be drained and recharged many times. Dual-purpose batteries try to do both, but they usually tolerate deep discharge less well than a true deep cycle. Read the listing for cycle figures and choose a deep cycle battery for a house bank."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "CCA and reserve capacity",
    "explanation": "Cold cranking amps tell you how well a battery starts an engine in the cold, while reserve capacity in minutes shows how long it runs a 25A load. Camper house loads depend more on reserve capacity and amp hours. Compare both numbers when the listing gives them."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Terminal type",
    "explanation": "Top posts, SAE posts and bolt terminals each need compatible cable ends. A battery with dual posts can accept both. Check the terminal in the listing against your existing cables before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and tray fit",
    "explanation": "Group 31 lead acid batteries can weigh over 60 lb, which matters when a tray is above a tool box or inside a camper. Lithium cuts that to roughly 22 lb. Check dimensions as well as the group number, since manufacturers vary slightly."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging, fuse and vent",
    "explanation": "AGM and lithium need different charging voltages, and flooded batteries need ventilation. Put a fuse or breaker close to the positive terminal and use cable sized for the load. Keep batteries secured and away from a sleeping area or tent."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What is a Group 31 battery?",
    "a": "Group 31 is a BCI size for large batteries, around 13 inches long and 6.8 inches wide. It fits many boat trays, trucks and campers. Always check the listed dimensions, since 31M marine versions can differ."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a dual-purpose battery as a house battery?",
    "a": "Yes for light use, but it handles deep discharge less well than a true deep cycle battery. Keep discharge shallow and recharge promptly. For daily off-grid use, a deep cycle or lithium battery lasts longer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is lithium worth it in Group 31?",
    "a": "If weight and usable capacity matter, lithium is a strong upgrade, as the LiTime weighs about 22 lb. It does not crank engines and needs a lithium charge profile. AGM or flooded is cheaper if the battery stays put."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a Group 31 AGM?",
    "a": "Use an AGM-compatible charger or a controller set to the AGM profile, around 14.4V for bulk charging as one listing names. Avoid overcharging. Charge promptly after use."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a flooded Group 31 healthy?",
    "a": "Check water levels, keep the terminals clean and charge in a ventilated space. Never charge near sparks or inside a closed tent. Wear eye protection when handling."
