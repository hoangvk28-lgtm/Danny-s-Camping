export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What three rooms actually means",
    "explanation": "A 3-room tent is one floor split by two curtains, with no solid wall between spaces. Sound and light still carry across. Look for how many divider curtains the listing says ship."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor dimensions",
    "explanation": "The same label covers a 14 x 8 ft floor and a 20 x 9 ft floor, and the difference decides bed fit. Wider floors fit queen beds side by side. Check the length and width against your mattress."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Room size after dividers",
    "explanation": "Each divided space is smaller than the whole, so a three-room layout may leave sleepers cramped. Divide the floor area by three. Check whether the curtains are removable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rain coating and seams",
    "explanation": "A millimeter rating shows how much water pressure the coating resists, and seams must be sealed. Low ratings leak in sustained rain. Look for numbers like 2000mm or 3000mm."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pole count and pitch",
    "explanation": "More poles mean a longer setup and more to lose. Color coding helps match them. Look for the pole count and a stated setup time."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do 3-room tents have solid walls between rooms?",
    "a": "No. The listings use two divider curtains that hang from hooks or ceiling points, so noise carries. They are best for visual privacy. Zip or hang them fully."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common 3-room mistake?",
    "a": "Assuming every room fits a queen bed. Divide the floor length by three and compare it with your mattress. Smaller floors may fit only sleeping bags."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the BravArrk worth it over the CAMPROS?",
    "a": "For rain, yes, since PU3000mm beats PU1000mm. The CAMPROS gives more floor and a faster pitch. Choose by weather or space."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a 3-room tent?",
    "a": "Stake the floor, assemble the poles by color, raise the frame and fit the fly. Add the curtains last. Two people work best."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stop the curtains sagging?",
    "a": "Hook them at every ceiling point and pull them taut. Add a clip if the listing offers one. Remove them when you want one open room."
