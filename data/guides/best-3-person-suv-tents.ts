export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decode 2 to 3 person",
    "explanation": "A 2 to 3 person rating means two adults fit, and a third is a child or a squeeze. Compare the floor width with the sum of your pad widths. A 63 inch floor fits two 25 inch pads with little to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mattress thickness matters",
    "explanation": "A 1.97 inch foam mattress feels very different from a thin air mattress after three nights. Thicker pads cost weight but keep hips off the shell. Look for the thickness in inches in the feature list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check rack capacity",
    "explanation": "A roof tent adds weight above the vehicle, which raises the center of gravity and wind noise. Add the tent weight to the sleepers and gear when you compare with your rack's dynamic and static limits. Find these numbers in the vehicle manual or the rack maker sheet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plan for headroom",
    "explanation": "A 47 inch peak lets a child sit up but not an adult. Tailgate tents offer far more standing height, often around 6.9 feet. Read the height number and decide who needs to stand."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh setup against price",
    "explanation": "A 30-second hydraulic lift saves effort on every trip, while an air pump adds a few minutes. Ground tents cost far less but sit on damp earth. Match the setup time to how often you will camp."

  },
  {
    "q": "What goes wrong with roof tents on SUVs?",
    "a": "Roof racks have a load limit, and a heavy tent can exceed it. Check both the dynamic and static ratings. Also confirm the tent opens clear of the hatch."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the cheaper tailgate tent a fair swap for a roof tent?",
    "a": "For a few weekends a year, yes. You give up an elevated, dry bed and quick setup. The Mount peak SUV Tent keeps gear and sleepers on one floor."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does setup take?",
    "a": "The hardshells list about 30 seconds, and the WGOS needs an air pump. A tailgate tent takes a few minutes with poles and stakes. Practice once at home."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store these tents?",
    "a": "Keep roof tents dry and closed on the roof, and open a window of vent after rain. Air the fabric fully before long storage. Wipe the shell and check the seals each season."
