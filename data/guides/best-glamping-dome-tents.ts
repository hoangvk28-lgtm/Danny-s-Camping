export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Clear vs opaque shell",
    "explanation": "A clear dome shows the whole sky and brings in light, but it offers little privacy and lets heat build in sun. An opaque dome keeps interiors dim and private. Decide whether stargazing or sleeping privacy matters more, and look for the listing's description of panel material."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Frame rigidity",
    "explanation": "Pop-up frames use flexible steel wire and fold flat, which makes them fast and easy to store. Rigid geodesic frames hold their shape better in wind but need assembly. Check the pole material named in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Usable height",
    "explanation": "A dome's center is the only place most people can stand fully, so a 5.7 ft peak feels very different from an 8 ft peak. Check the listed height and picture where you will place chairs or beds. A tall peak matters more for families than couples."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature range and sun",
    "explanation": "Clear PVC and TPU panels trap warmth, so heat in summer can be as real an issue as cold in winter. A stated temperature range shows where the manufacturer expects the dome to work. Look for the listed range and plan shade for midday."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Anchoring and wind",
    "explanation": "Domes are light and catch wind, so stakes and wind ropes are not optional. A stated wind rating, such as 31 mph, gives a limit to respect. Check that stakes and ropes are in the box, and plan to take it down in strong gusts."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can you sleep in a bubble dome tent?",
    "a": "Yes, some people do, but listings for the pop-up models mainly describe lounging and stargazing and do not state sleeping capacity. The VEVOR Garden Dome is rated for 2 to 4 adults. Plan on cots or mats and use shade during the day."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do bubble tents get too hot?",
    "a": "Clear panels let sun heat the inside, so plan shade and use the roll-up windows. The VEVOR pop-up models include two side windows for airflow. Avoid parking them in direct afternoon sun."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the VEVOR Garden Dome worth the extra money?",
    "a": "If you want a rigid frame, a rated temperature range and heat-sealed seams for a longer stay, yes. For a weekend lounge, the pop-up VEVOR models cost far less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a pop-up bubble tent?",
    "a": "Unfold it and let the frame spring open, then stake the corners and clip the wind ropes. The luminous stakes help you spot guy lines at night. Fold it by twisting the frame back into its carry bag."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean a clear dome tent?",
    "a": "Wipe the panels with a soft cloth and mild soap, and avoid abrasive pads that scratch. Let it dry fully before packing. Store it flat or loosely folded to avoid creasing."
