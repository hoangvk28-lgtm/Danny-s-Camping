export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Real AC output versus a wall plug",
    "explanation": "A power bank with an AC outlet outputs household voltage, and a bank with a foldable plug only uses that plug to recharge itself. This matters because the second kind cannot run a device with a standard plug. Check whether the listing says AC output, AC outlet or AC plug."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "What 65W of AC can run",
    "explanation": "A 65W AC outlet suits laptop chargers, camera chargers, small fans and phone bricks. A coffee maker, hair dryer or heater needs far more and will trip the protection. Add up the wattage printed on your device's label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wh and carry-on rules",
    "explanation": "Capacity in Wh decides whether a bank can fly. Airlines generally limit carry-on banks to 100Wh, and the powkey prints 88.8Wh. Look for a Wh figure or multiply mAh by 3.7 and divide by 1000."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine or modified sine",
    "explanation": "Many small AC banks do not state their wave type. Sensitive electronics and motor loads can run poorly on a modified sine output. The listing does not state the waveform for these AC banks, so use them for simple chargers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge routes",
    "explanation": "A bank that charges from wall, car and solar is easier to keep full. A solar panel adds off-grid use but works slowly in cloud. Compare the input wattage and any included panel."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can these banks run a coffee maker or heater?",
    "a": "No. The AC outlets top out at 65W and the plug banks have no AC output. Heating appliances need far more power."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are the wall-plug banks AC power banks?",
    "a": "They are not. The plug is how they recharge, and they output USB only. They are listed here as the nearest fit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is an AC power bank worth it over an inverter?",
    "a": "For one laptop charger, a 65W AC bank is far simpler. An inverter and a battery serve larger loads. Choose by the wattage you need."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a laptop from the AC outlet?",
    "a": "Plug the laptop's own charger into the outlet and switch the bank on. Check the charger's wattage stays under 65W. Stop if the bank gets hot."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a printed Wh rating important?",
    "a": "Yes, since it shows whether the bank is carry-on friendly and how much energy it holds. The powkey prints 88.8Wh. Compute Wh from mAh when the listing does not."
