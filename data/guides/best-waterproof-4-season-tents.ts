Its fly is 75D polyester with silver coating rated 3000mm waterproof, its floor is 150D Oxford rated 4000mm with seam-taped corners, and the poles are 7001 aluminum. The removable inner measures 86.6 by 59 by 63 inches and the whole package weighs about 16.5 lb.\n\nIt has the highest floor rating in this list at 4000mm and the only snow skirt, while the OneTigris Stella lists a 3000mm rating on a much lighter nylon fly. Against the VEVOR bell tent, it is a double-wall dome with a removable inner, so condensation stays off the sleepers.\n\nIt suits winter campers who want a taped, rated floor and a stove jack in a tent a couple can still carry to a trailhead. The vestibule holds boots and wet gear out of the sleeping area.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Fly and floor ratings",
    "explanation": "A hydrostatic head such as 3000mm resists steady rain, while a 4000mm floor handles wet ground and snow melt. Look for ratings on both the fly and the floor. A listing with no millimeter figure gives you nothing to compare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Taped seams",
    "explanation": "Water enters at seams before it comes through the fabric. Seam-taped corners and a bathtub floor matter as much as the rating. Check for the words taped or sealed in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Condensation",
    "explanation": "Winter tents trap moisture from breath, so a double wall or good vents are vital. A single wall without vents can drip on sleepers. Open top vents slightly even when it is cold."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stove safety",
    "explanation": "If a tent has a stove jack, use only a stove and pipe set that the tent maker approves. Keep clearance from fabric, ventilate and run a carbon monoxide alarm. Never use a stove in a tent without a stove jack."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pole strength",
    "explanation": "Aluminum poles flex in wind, while galvanized steel is stiffer and heavier. A 16 lb tent is fine for a vehicle but heavy for a pack. Match weight to how far you carry it."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What does a 3000mm waterproof rating mean?",
    "a": "It means the fabric resists a 3000mm column of water pressure before leaking, enough for steady rain. Higher numbers suit heavier rain or wet ground. Check the rating on both the fly and the floor."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a wood stove in any four-season tent?",
    "a": "No. Only use a stove in a tent with a stove jack, and only a stove and pipe the maker approves. Keep clearance, ventilate and use a carbon monoxide alarm. Never sleep with a stove burning."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a hot tent worth it over a plain four-season tent?",
    "a": "A stove makes winter camping far more comfortable but adds weight, risk and cost. Backpackers usually skip it. Car campers and groups gain the most."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I reduce condensation in a winter tent?",
    "a": "Open top vents a little, keep wet gear in the vestibule and avoid cooking inside without ventilation. A double wall helps. Wipe the walls in the morning."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I dry a tent after a snowy trip?",
    "a": "Shake off snow, hang the tent to dry fully and store it loose. Check seams and zippers. Reseal worn seams if needed."
