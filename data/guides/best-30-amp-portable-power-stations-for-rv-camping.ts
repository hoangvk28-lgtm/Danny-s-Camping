export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "TT-30 versus 30A AC",
    "explanation": "An RV shore-power plug is a three-prong TT-30, which carries up to 30 amps at 120V, or about 3,600W. A station with a TT30 outlet accepts that plug directly. Check the port list for the exact outlet name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated watts versus a 30A circuit",
    "explanation": "A 30A circuit can carry 3,600W, but most portable stations rate less than that. A 2,400W station cannot run a 3,000W air conditioner and microwave together. Add up the watts of what you will run at once."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Air conditioner limits",
    "explanation": "RV air conditioners need a large starting surge and can draw more than the running figure when they start. Check the surge rating and whether the maker lists air conditioner support. Run a soft starter if the unit trips."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and runtime",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours divided by load watts gives runtime. A 1,500W load drains 2,304Wh in about 1.5 hours before losses. Match capacity to how long you will run big loads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharging while on the road",
    "explanation": "Alternator or solar charging keeps a station topped up between campgrounds. Look for 12V car input, solar watts and any 48V RV port. Read the listing for the maximum input in watts."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a portable power station run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "It depends on the AC unit's starting surge and the station's output. Check the maker's guidance and the unit's surge rating before relying on it."
  },
  {
    "q": "What adapter do I need for a 30A RV plug?",
    "a": "A station with a TT30 port takes a standard RV plug directly. A 30A AC outlet on the ABOK Ark3600 may need a matching plug type, so check the shape."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 30A the same as 3,600W?",
    "a": "At 120V it is the maximum, but the station's own rating is usually lower. Both picks rate below 3,600W continuous or only near it."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge on the road?",
    "a": "Use solar, an AC wall outlet or an alternator charging kit, depending on the model. The BLUETTI AC200PL lists 1,200W of solar input and a 48V RV port."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store the station?",
    "a": "Keep it at partial charge in a cool dry place. Top it up every few months so the cells stay healthy."
