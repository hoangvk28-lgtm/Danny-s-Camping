export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Why choose a rectangle",
    "explanation": "A rectangle opens flat, zips to a partner and leaves room to turn. The cost is warmth, since there is more air to heat. Pair it with a good pad to offset that."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Read the rating type",
    "explanation": "Comfort is the planning number. The HiZYNICE prints comfort, limit and extreme, and the KANYAK prints comfort and limit. A single label like 0 degrees on the Deer Hunter is a limit-class figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size and weight",
    "explanation": "The Coleman Brazos fits to 5 ft 11 in, and the HiZYNICE fits to 6 ft 7 in. The Heritage holds 5 lb of fill. Match size to your frame."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill and lining",
    "explanation": "Synthetic fill keeps warmth when damp, and flannel feels warm on entry. Canvas shells are rugged but heavy. Check the fill name on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Splicing and zippers",
    "explanation": "Splicing lets two bags make a double. Only the KANYAK lists it. Look for matching zipper sides if you want to pair bags."

  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with rectangles?",
    "a": "Ignoring the pad. The ground steals heat, so use a pad with a stated R-value."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the HiZYNICE worth it over the Brazos?",
    "a": "If you are tall or want printed ratings, yes. For shorter campers the Brazos costs less."
