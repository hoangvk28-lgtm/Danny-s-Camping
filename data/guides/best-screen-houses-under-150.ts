export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Steel or fiberglass frame",
    "explanation": "A steel main structure resists bending in wind and holds a pop-up frame square, while fiberglass flexes and can splinter after a few seasons. Pop-up scissors use steel joints that can bind if bent. Look for the frame material in the product details. Bent joints are the usual failure point, so handle the frame gently when packing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mesh density",
    "explanation": "D33 fine mesh blocks no-see-ums and tiny gnats, while standard mesh lets small insects through. A finer mesh also cuts airflow slightly, so it suits humid, buggy sites more than breezy ones. Look for a stated mesh grade in the description. If your campsite is by water, pick the finer mesh."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size for your table",
    "explanation": "A six-person table needs about 10 by 10 feet with walking room, and a movie setup with a screen needs more. Add a foot of clearance on each side of the table. Check the floor and ceiling dimensions rather than the person rating. Remember that a bigger room also needs a bigger flat site."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Doors and entry",
    "explanation": "Magnetic doors close behind you and keep bugs out when your hands are full, while zippered doors seal tighter but need both hands. Poor alignment leaves gaps at the top corners. Check which door type the room uses and how many entries it has. Two entries make flow easier for a big group."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind rating",
    "explanation": "Mesh rooms catch wind like sails, so stake and guy every point and use sandbags on hard surfaces. Wind panels help block gusts but add more area for the wind to push. Look for the stake count and guy points in the package list. Never leave a room staked out in a storm warning."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is the DMH projection screen worth it?",
    "a": "If you plan outdoor movies, yes, because it saves buying a screen and the 7.5 foot ceiling suits seating. You still need a projector and power. Otherwise the TAILGATERZ Magnetic is cheaper and offers similar headroom."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do pop-ups last as long as pole rooms?",
    "a": "Pop-up scissors can bind or bend over time if forced. The East Oak 10x10 Pop-Up has a steel frame, which helps. Store it dry and fold it exactly as the instructions show to protect the joints."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mesh blocks no-see-ums?",
    "a": "D33 fine mesh blocks tiny insects, as on the East Oak 10x10 Pop-Up. Standard mesh may let no-see-ums through. Check the mesh grade in the product details before you buy for buggy sites. Fine mesh matters most near water and woods at dusk."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I anchor a screen house?",
    "a": "Stake all corners and guy lines in soil, or weigh the legs with sandbags on a patio. Add a stake at each wind panel pull-out. Take the room down in storms rather than risk bent poles."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use these in the rain?",
    "a": "Tops shed light rain, but mesh sides let wind-driven rain in. A tarp over the top helps a lot in steady rain. Keep gear and electronics off the floor and away from the walls. Pitch on a slight slope away from the door so water runs off."
