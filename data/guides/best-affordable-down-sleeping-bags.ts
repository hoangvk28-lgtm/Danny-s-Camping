  {
    "criterion": "Fill power versus fill weight",
    "explanation": "A 750 fill power figure shows loft per ounce. Fill weight shows how much down is inside. Both numbers matter for warmth."

  {
    "criterion": "Rating tied to the version",
    "explanation": "Some listings sell several fill levels under one title. A 0.88 lb fill and a 1.76 lb fill are very different bags. Make sure you pick the version you read about."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Down type",
