  {
    "criterion": "Voltage first",
    "explanation": "A 350W panel often has an open-circuit voltage of 40 to 50 volts, which only large stations accept. Read the station's solar input limit and compare. Never connect above it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real output",
    "explanation": "In good sun a 350W panel yields about 210 to 280 watts. Heat, haze and angle reduce it further. Plan around real output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "Panels of 22 to 31 pounds are a two-hand carry. Check folded size against your trunk. A briefcase fold stores easier than a flat one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty length",
    "explanation": "Warranty terms vary from a few months to years, and a longer one signals confidence. Check the listing for the term and what it covers. Keep your order number."
