export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Form factor sets the use",
    "explanation": "A blanket or foldable rides in a car and sets up on the ground, while a rigid glass panel mounts on a roof. Pick based on whether the array moves or stays. Check the listing for folded size and whether it ships with mounting hardware."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Partial shade behavior",
    "explanation": "Shade across even one cell can pull down a whole panel, because cells are wired in series. Panels with independent zones and bypass diodes keep the lit zones producing. Look for zone counts or bypass diodes named on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage must fit the station",
    "explanation": "A 36V or 40V panel can exceed the solar input limit of some portable stations. Read the maximum input voltage in your station manual and compare it with the panel's open-circuit voltage. A mismatch can damage the station."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real output versus rating",
    "explanation": "A 250W panel seldom produces 250W, because heat and sun angle usually hold it to 60 to 80 percent. Rear-side gain on a bifacial panel adds only when light reaches the back. Plan around real watts, not the sticker."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight, size and setup",
    "explanation": "A 250W blanket weighs around 12 lbs yet unrolls to over four feet on each side, so check your camp space. Look at stakes, carabiners and straps in the box. Folded and open dimensions are on the listing."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is there a true 250W foldable panel?",
    "a": "Yes, the ZOUPW 250W Blanket is one. Listings at this exact size are scarce, so many buyers look at 200W or 400W options instead."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with 250W panels?",
    "a": "Ignoring the voltage. A 36V CTOLITY 400W Foldable will not suit every station. Match the panel voltage to the station before buying."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the 400W foldable worth it over the 250W?",
    "a": "If your station accepts the voltage and watts, yes, since it charges faster. For a small station the ZOUPW 250W Blanket is lighter and easier to place."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a solar blanket?",
    "a": "Lay it flat in open sun, stake the corner loops and keep the cable clear of foot traffic. Tilt it toward the sun if possible. Connect to the station before turning the station on."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a rigid panel be used portably?",
    "a": "It can sit on the ground, though it is heavy and fragile on a bumpy trip. A fixed panel such as the Renogy 250W Bifacial is better bolted to a roof."
