  {
    "criterion": "Heat and cold",
    "explanation": "Cars reach very high temperatures in summer, which can degrade ointments and caplets. Medicines in a trunk may last better than in a glove box, away from direct sun. Look for expiry dates and plan to check them each spring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hard shell or soft bag",
