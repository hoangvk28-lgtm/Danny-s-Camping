It carries a dimmable light with adjustable color temperature, a hanging hook and a remote that mirrors the body buttons.\n\nIt moves far more air than the FIALAME and the Coolice because its blade span is far wider.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Overhead mounting point",
    "explanation": "A hanging fan loads one point of the tent with its full weight, so the strength of the hub or loop matters. A 31.5-inch ceiling fan carries more weight than a lantern fan on a hook. Look for the fan's weight in the listing and compare it with what the tent's ridge or hub is built to hold."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Blade span versus tent size",
    "explanation": "Bigger blades move more air at lower speeds, which also means a quieter night. A small fan on a big tent only cools the corner under it. Match blade diameter to the number of people, and treat the listing's tent suggestions as a hint, not a measurement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime per speed",
    "explanation": "A battery claim is almost always the low-speed figure, so a 65-hour claim may fall to a handful of hours on high. Runtime listings that give three figures, one per speed, are the honest ones. Check the number for the speed you will actually use at midnight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote and timer",
    "explanation": "A remote lets you change speed without leaving your bag, and a timer shuts the fan off after you fall asleep. Timers of 2 to 8 hours are common. Look for whether the remote also controls the light, since that saves a second reach."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Blade handling and storage",
    "explanation": "Detachable blades pack flat and survive a bin better than fixed ones, yet they add a fitting step every night. A fixed head with a hook skips that. Check the listing to see whether the blades come off and how long assembly takes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Light quality at night",
    "explanation": "Light on the fan saves carrying a lantern, and adjustable color temperature lets you use warm white for sleeping. Brightness steps matter more than a top lumen figure. Look for dimming and for whether the light runs without the fan."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What size of tent can a hanging fan realistically cool?",
    "a": "It depends on blade span. A 31.5-inch fan like the SHUNLEE suits a canopy or a large cabin tent, an 18-inch fan like the FIALAME suits a medium cabin, and a small hook fan like the Coolice suits a dome. Think of the fan as cooling the people under it, not the whole shelter."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a hanging fan damage my tent loop?",
    "a": "It can if the fan is heavy and the loop is thin. Spread the weight across two loops or hang from a pole when the fan is large. The FIALAME and Coolice are lighter loads than the SHUNLEE, so start with the smaller ones on lighter tents."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a ceiling fan worth it over a clip-on fan?",
    "a": "If more than one person is in the tent, yes. Overhead air moves evenly across the floor and keeps cords and fan bodies off the sleeping area. A clip-on or hook fan wins only when one person wants air aimed at their bag."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I hang one in a tent with no center hub?",
    "a": "Use the foldable hook or a carabiner on a ridge loop, a pole sleeve or the gear loft strap. Check that the fan swings clear of the fabric at its highest speed before you sleep. A second line to a pole stops swaying."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep the battery from running flat overnight?",
    "a": "Run the lowest speed that keeps you comfortable and use the timer, since most runtime figures are low-speed claims. Charge the fan during the day from a power bank or car. Keep it out of direct sun in a closed car."
