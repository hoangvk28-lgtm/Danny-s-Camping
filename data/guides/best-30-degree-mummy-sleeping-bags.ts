  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and fill",
    "explanation": "A mummy under 3 lb is light for car or trail. Fill type affects damp performance. Look for a named fill and printed weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Draft collar and tube",
    "explanation": "A draft collar seals the neck and a tube seals the zipper. Together they cut heat loss on cool nights. Check both are named."

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do campers make with mummies?",
    "a": "They buy a size that is too short and press their feet against the end. That compresses insulation and cools the toes. Check the fit height before you order."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the LEEF worth it over the Retrospec?",
    "a": "If you want margin below 30F and a roomier cut, yes. If you want the lowest weight and cost, the Retrospec Dream 30 is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use the draw cords on a mummy hood?",
    "a": "Pull the main cord to close the hood around your face and leave the breathing hole open. Use the second cord to cinch the draft collar. Keep your face out of the bag to avoid condensation."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a mummy bag?",
