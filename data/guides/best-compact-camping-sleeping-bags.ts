export const buyingCriteria = [

  {
    "criterion": "Reading packed dimensions",
    "explanation": "A packed height of 6.9 inches is not the same as a package size of 7.9 x 4.7 inches. Check what the listing measures. Compare like with like."

    "criterion": "Weight",
    "explanation": "A 1.5 lb bag and a 1.7 lb bag differ little in the hand. Ratings differ more. Check weight and range together."

  {
    "criterion": "Length for taller sleepers",
    "explanation": "A 75 inch bag fits a sleeper of about six feet, while 83 inches gives more room. A bag shorter than you pushes insulation flat at your feet. Check printed length against your height."
