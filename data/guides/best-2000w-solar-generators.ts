  {
    "criterion": "2000W continuous or 2000W surge",
    "explanation": "A station can show 2000W as its everyday limit or as a brief peak for starting motors. Only continuous output keeps a microwave or heater running. Look for words like rated or continuous beside the 2000W figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours decide runtime",
    "explanation": "A 2000W load drains a 1,024Wh battery in about half an hour. Divide the watt-hours by your load watts for a rough time before losses. If you want a coffee maker for minutes and a fridge for hours, a mid-size battery works."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input limits",
    "explanation": "The solar input figure is the most the station can accept, such as 800W or 1,200W. A 100W panel supplies only a fraction of that, so charging will be slow. Match the number and wattage of your panels to the listed input range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel included or not",
    "explanation": "Several kits ship with a single 100W panel, which tops up a small battery over a long day. A bare station is cheaper but needs panels bought separately. Read the title for the words panel included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Expansion and UPS",
    "explanation": "Expansion batteries lift capacity later without a new inverter, and a UPS switch of 10ms keeps a router running through outages. Check the listing for named expansion packs and the maximum capacity. Skip it if you only want weekend camping power."

  },
  {
    "q": "Is a single 100W panel enough?",
    "a": "It is enough for slow top-ups over many days. A 100W panel needs roughly ten hours of full sun to refill a 1,000Wh battery, so plan on several days."

    "q": "Is 2000W worth it over 1000W?",
