export const buyingCriteria = [
  {

    "explanation": "A fan has to stay put in a moving or parked vehicle. Clamps grip headrests and rails, hooks hang from grab handles, and tripod legs wrap onto bars. Check the listing for the specific mount type and whether it fits the surfaces you have."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity for a full night",
    "explanation": "A night in a car can run 8 to 10 hours. Fans with 3000mAh may last only 3 to 8 hours, while 20,000mAh models can run far longer. Read the stated runtime at the speed you will use and match it to your sleep time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging while you drive",
    "explanation": "A fan that charges by USB from the car's port or a power bank is easy to top up during the day. Look for a Type-C port and a quoted charge time. The 12V cigarette socket usually supports about 150W, which is far more than any of these fans need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise in a small cabin",
    "explanation": "Sound reflects inside a vehicle and is louder than in a tent. Quiet claims such as 22dB or 30dB matter more than airflow. A listing that gives no decibel number means you will have to listen for yourself."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Child and pet safety",
    "explanation": "In a family vehicle, little hands can reach a clip fan. A narrow grille gap, like the 5.6mm gaps on the Socool Car Seat Fan, keeps fingers out of the blades. Check the grille description and where the cable runs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lantern and light output",
    "explanation": "A fan with a light saves space, but both draw from the same battery. Choose a model with several brightness levels so you can dim it for sleep. Look for the number of levels in the product details."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I charge a camping fan from my car?",
    "a": "Yes, with a USB adapter or power bank. The ONLYNEW 20000mAh Fan and OpenBay Clip Fan charge over Type-C, so a standard car charger works. The vehicle socket supports roughly 150W, far above what these fans draw."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with car camping fans?",
    "a": "Leaving a pack to run flat overnight in a parked car. A 3000mAh clip fan lasts only a few hours, so choose a larger pack or keep a power bank handy."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a clip fan better than a lantern fan?",
    "a": "It depends on the space. A clip like the OpenBay Clip Fan aims airflow at one person, while a lantern fan like the AMACOOL Lantern Fan spreads air and light together."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I mount a fan inside a vehicle?",
    "a": "Clamp it to a headrest or seat rail, or hang it from a grab handle with the hook. Keep cables away from pedals and doors, and pull the unit down before driving."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is it safe to leave a fan running while I sleep?",
    "a": "A rechargeable fan on low is generally fine in a parked vehicle, but keep ventilation open and never block the intake. The Odoland Lantern Fan on D cells avoids charging heat."
