  {
    "criterion": "True capacity versus label",
    "explanation": "Only one listing names a single 40,000mAh pack, and others describe a combined cell total. A 36,000mAh fan made from two swappable packs is not the same as one pack. Read the title and the first bullet for the exact capacity."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low versus high runtime",
    "explanation": "A big pack gives 70 to 80 hours on the lowest speed and far fewer on high. Plan nights on low with a timer. A listed best-case number is the low-speed one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge time for a big pack",
    "explanation": "A 40,000mAh battery needs many hours to refill from a small charger. A 5V 2A adapter can take most of a day. Check the charge time and the adapter size on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and bulk",
    "explanation": "Large packs add weight and size, so a 10-inch fan with a big pack is heavy to hang. Check the hook rating and the fan's weight. Stand it on a table if the tent ceiling is flimsy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Swappable versus built-in pack",
    "explanation": "A swappable pack lets you rotate batteries during a trip, while a built-in pack must be charged in place. Swappable designs help on long trips. Check whether the second battery is included."

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make?",
    "a": "Running a big pack on high speed and expecting the low-speed runtime. High speed drains it much faster. Use low speed and a timer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 40,000mAh worth it over 20,000mAh?",
    "a": "For multi-night trips yes, and the extra size adds weight. For a weekend, 20,000mAh is enough. See the 20,000mAh guide for those."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I recharge a big pack?",
    "a": "Use the supplied cable with a wall adapter or power station. Expect many hours. Charge before leaving."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain the fan?",
    "a": "Clean the blades, keep the grille dry and recharge the pack every few months in storage. Do not leave it in a hot car. Check the hook before hanging."
