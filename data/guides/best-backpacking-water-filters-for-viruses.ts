It also filters particulates and microplastics and adsorbs VOCs, PFAS, pesticides, heavy metals and odors.\n\nIt purifies 24 oz at a time with no pump, hose, battery or waiting, and the replaceable cartridge is good for 65 gallons (250 L). Compared with the Fusion Delta it is a bottle you press, not a pour-through cup filter.\n\nIt suits travelers and backpackers who want a single device that purifies on the spot, including from a tap or hotel sink.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Filter versus purifier",
    "explanation": "A filter removes bacteria and protozoa, and a purifier is also built to remove viruses. Viruses are far smaller than the pores in a typical hollow fiber membrane. Look for the word virus on the listing, not just the word purifier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Where viruses matter",
    "explanation": "Virus risk is higher in regions with limited sanitation and in water downstream of human activity. In most remote North American backcountry, a filter is usually enough. Check your destination before paying for extra protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named pathogens and percentages",
    "explanation": "A good listing names the viruses it covers and gives a percentage. The GRAYL GeoPress lists rotavirus, norovirus and hepatitis A, and the Fusion Delta lists 99.99 percent. Look for specifics, and be careful with a generic claim of safe water."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Batch size and speed",
    "explanation": "A 24 oz press purifies one bottle at a time, and a pour-through filter is slower. Plan your water needs per day and add a filter for cooking and bulk water. Read the batch size on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cartridge life and cost",
    "explanation": "Purifier cartridges wear out faster than hollow fiber filters. The GRAYL GeoPress cartridge is good for 65 gallons, which is about 250 liters. Check the lifespan and the replacement price before you buy."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do most backpacking filters remove viruses?",
    "a": "No. Most use a 0.1 micron hollow fiber membrane that blocks bacteria and protozoa but not viruses. Only listings that state virus removal should be trusted for it."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is virus removal necessary in the US?",
    "a": "Usually not in remote backcountry, but it matters near populated areas or abroad. Weigh the risk for your route. When in doubt, choose a purifier or add chemical tablets."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the GRAYL worth its price over a filter?",
    "a": "If you travel abroad or camp downstream of towns, yes. For clear mountain streams in the US, a cheaper filter is enough. The GRAYL also handles chemicals the listing names."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use the Fusion Delta?",
    "a": "Place the filter in a cup and pour water through it, like a coffee filter. Do not squeeze it. Use a clean cup for the output."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I combine a filter with tablets?",
    "a": "Yes. Filter first for bacteria and protozoa, then treat with chemical tablets for viruses. Tablets need full contact time, often 30 minutes or more, per the label."
