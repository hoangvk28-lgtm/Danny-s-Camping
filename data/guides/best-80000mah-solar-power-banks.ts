export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What a tiny solar panel does",
    "explanation": "A 5W panel adds a trickle of charge. At best it adds a few watt-hours a day, while an 80000mAh bank holds about 296 watt-hours. Treat the panel as an emergency top-up and charge the bank from a wall or car before you leave."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity math",
    "explanation": "80000mAh at a nominal 3.7 volts is roughly 296 watt-hours before conversion losses. Real delivered energy is lower, often 70 to 85 percent. A phone battery of about 15 Wh would charge perhaps 15 times, so check the listing's stated count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Output wattage",
    "explanation": "A 35W USB-C port suits phones and tablets and charges a laptop slowly. A 100W port suits most laptops, and a 130W AC outlet covers a laptop brick or small fan. Look for the maximum output per port and the total across all ports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flying with it",
    "explanation": "Airlines generally limit carry-on power banks to 100 Wh without approval and about 160 Wh with it. A 296 Wh bank exceeds both. Check airline rules before travel and plan to drive."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Heat and storage",
    "explanation": "Lithium banks should not sit in a hot car or direct sun, and charging below freezing can damage them. Store at about half charge when idle. Look for overheating and short-circuit protection on the listing."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can an 80000mAh bank run a camping fridge?",
    "a": "Not reliably. The Feidyns banks list USB outputs, while the Volessence 296Wh offers 130W AC, which is below the draw of most compressor fridges at startup. Check the fridge's rated watts first."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with solar power banks?",
    "a": "Relying on the panel to refill the bank. A 5W panel is a trickle charger, so charge from a wall or car before you go."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Volessence worth it over the Feidyns banks?",
    "a": "If you need an AC outlet or a 100W USB-C port, yes. The Volessence 296Wh powers a laptop and small gear, while the Feidyns 7-Port and Feidyns 9-Port are cheaper phone hubs."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge an 80000mAh bank fully?",
    "a": "Use a wall adapter or the highest-wattage input the listing names. The Volessence 296Wh lists a DC input that fills it in 4.5 hours, and the Feidyns banks take longer on a standard adapter."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I fly with an 80000mAh bank?",
    "a": "Probably not in carry-on. Many airlines limit power banks to 100 Wh, or about 160 Wh with approval, and these banks hold around 296 Wh. Check with your airline before traveling."
