export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What synthetic fill does well",
    "explanation": "Synthetic insulation keeps more warmth when damp and dries faster than down. It is also easier to wash and usually costs less. Look for a named fill such as Cirroloft or Cloudloft rather than a vague label like polyester fiber."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "What 40 degrees means",
    "explanation": "A 40 degree rating is a lower limit for a typical sleeper, so comfort sits warmer. It suits summer and mild fall nights. Treat it as a summer bag and carry a liner for cool spells."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "Fill weight tells you how much insulation is inside, and stuff size tells you how much pack space it takes. A bag with 24 oz of fill and a 15 x 8 inch stuff size is easy to plan around. If a listing prints neither, weigh and measure it yourself."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Quilted layout",
    "explanation": "How the fill is stitched decides whether cold spots form at the seams. Offset quilting spreads the fill evenly, while shifting fill leaves thin areas. Check the listing for the construction method by name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit and footbox",
    "explanation": "A tight footbox pins your toes and chills them. Look for a stated fit height and a spacious or natural footbox. Taller campers should compare the printed length to their own."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 40 degree synthetic bag enough for summer?",
    "a": "Yes for most summer nights and mild shoulder seasons. Below about 45F you will want a liner or layers. The Kelty Cosmic Synthetic 40 is labeled 2-season for that reason."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do buyers get wrong about synthetic bags?",
    "a": "They assume all synthetic fill is the same. Fill weight, quilting and shell all change warmth. Compare the printed numbers, not just the word synthetic."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Kelty Cosmic worth over the Mistral?",
    "a": "If you backpack, yes, because it prints weight and stuff size. For car camping, the Kelty Mistral 40F is cheaper and does the basics. Read the fill label on either."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a bag in a tent?",
    "a": "Shake it out before bed so the fill lofts, and lay it over a pad. Keep it off damp tent walls. Use the compression sack only for transport."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a synthetic bag?",
    "a": "Store it loose in a large breathable sack, not compressed. Wash on gentle cold if the label allows, as the Coleman Biscayne 40F Big & Tall states. Dry it fully first."
