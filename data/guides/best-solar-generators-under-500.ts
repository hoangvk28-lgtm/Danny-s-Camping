export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity against cycles",
    "explanation": "A 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery rated for 3000 cycles delivers about 3 megawatt-hours over its life, while a 512Wh pack at 6000 cycles delivers about the same. That is why a more expensive, smaller Jackery can be a fair deal over ten years. Look at both numbers and multiply them to compare real lifetime energy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel size in the bundle",
    "explanation": "A 100W panel recovers around 300 to 400Wh on a sunny day, a 40W panel about 120 to 160Wh. A bundle with a 40W panel on a 292Wh station needs two days to refill. Compare the panel watts with the battery size, and aim for a panel of at least a third of the battery watt-hours."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC outlet count and wattage",
    "explanation": "Two AC outlets let you run a laptop and a fan without a power strip, while one outlet needs an extension. Continuous output of 500W suits a fan, TV and lights, while 1000W suits a coffee maker or a small induction cooker for short bursts. Look for the continuous wattage and outlet count in the specs, not only the peak figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "Moving from 500Wh to 1 kWh nearly doubles the weight: 14 lb for the Explorer 500 v2 against 27.73 lb for the STARYLINE. At 28 lb you want a handle and a short carry, ideally car to table. Read the lb figure and imagine lifting it to a picnic table."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging speed",
    "explanation": "Wall charging takes 52 minutes to 80 percent on the Jackery but 7 to 8 hours on the 1000W EBL. Fast charging matters when you cannot count on a long sunny day, and it turns a drive into a top-up. Look for the 0 to 80 percent time and the solar input in watts."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a panel to use a solar generator?",
    "a": "No. Any station can recharge from a wall outlet or a car socket, and the panel adds off-grid recharging. The GRECELL 500W Panel Bundle and Jackery Solar Gen 300 Kit include one, while the STARYLINE 1000W and EBL 1000W need a separate one."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will a 1 kWh unit run a fridge?",
    "a": "A small 12V or 110V cooler drawing 50W averages about 20 hours on 1000Wh after inverter losses, and a CPAP adds 40 to 60Wh a night. The STARYLINE 1000W and EBL 1000W suit this, and the Jackery 500 v2 lasts about half as long."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 6000 cycles worth paying more for?",
    "a": "If you camp 40 weekends a year, 6000 cycles lasts decades, but 3000 cycles still lasts about 8 years. The Jackery Explorer 500 v2 earns its price if you want the lightest pack and the best warranty, not just cycles."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I connect any panel to these?",
    "a": "Only if the panel's voltage and connector match the station. The EBL 1000W accepts 12 to 26V at up to 8A, and the STARYLINE 1000W accepts up to 300W. Match the open-circuit voltage to the input limit before plugging in, and use the supplied adapters."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use one while it charges?",
    "a": "Pass-through charging works on the EBL 1000W and most picks here, but it generates heat and some units reduce charging speed under load. Use the fan, keep vents clear and avoid covering the station in a car on hot days."
