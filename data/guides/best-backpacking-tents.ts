  {
    "criterion": "Weight and who carries it",
    "explanation": "A two-person tent around 4 to 5 lb is a good target, since two hikers can split it. Listings that give an exact packed weight are easier to trust. Check whether footprints or stakes are included in the number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor space and peak height",
    "explanation": "Two adults on standard pads need about 50 inches of width. A 42 to 44 inch peak lets you sit up. Compare listed dimensions rather than the person label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seams and floors",
    "explanation": "Taped or welded seams and a bathtub floor keep water out of the stitching. A rating of 3000mm suits steady rain. Look for both on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Doors, vestibules and entry",
    "explanation": "Two doors mean no climbing over a partner at night, and a vestibule keeps wet boots out of the sleeping area. Single-door tents save weight. Check the layout."
