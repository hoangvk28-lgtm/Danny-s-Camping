export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Flame control",
    "explanation": "Cooking needs a range from a gentle simmer to a hot sear. A valve or dial that turns smoothly gives that range. Look for words like precise heat control or simmer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Output for searing",
    "explanation": "Searing and frying need higher BTU than boiling water. 15,000 BTU is strong for one burner. Match output to the food you cook."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pan stability",
    "explanation": "A wide pan on a small stove can tip. Wide supports or a stabilizer help. Check the listed pot width."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind guard",
    "explanation": "Wind chills a pan fast. A guard or net keeps the flame steady. Check whether the guard is built in."
  },

    "q": "Do I need a wind guard?",
    "a": "Yes, when cooking outdoors. A built-in guard or carry case windbreak keeps the flame steady."
