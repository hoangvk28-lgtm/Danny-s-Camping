export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Ice life at a stated temperature",
    "explanation": "Coleman lists up to 5 days of ice at 90F on two models. That claim is conditional and best case, and real results will vary with how often you open the lid. Look for the temperature next to the days on any listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity you will fill",
    "explanation": "A 70 quart cooler is overkill for two people, and a half-empty one loses cold faster than a packed one. Bigger chests also need more ice, which takes space from food. Match the size to your group and the number of days."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wheels versus handles",
    "explanation": "A loaded 62 quart cooler weighs a lot, and wheels add little cost. If you carry it only a few steps from car to site, handles will do. Look at wheel size and handle design on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UV and latch quality",
    "explanation": "Sun weakens plastic and cheap latches break after a season or two. UV inhibitors and stainless hinge parts help a cooler last. Look for those words on the listing if you camp or fish in strong sun."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Soft versus hard",
    "explanation": "A soft cooler weighs about 1.8 lbs but holds cold for hours, while a hard chest holds ice for days. Pick by trip length, not by price alone. Many campers use a hard cooler for food and a soft bag for drinks."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lid design",
    "explanation": "A lid that closes snugly keeps cold in, and a loose one lets warm air through and shortens ice life by hours. At this price the lid and latch are where cost gets cut. Check for gasket or latch wording on the listing, and press the lid shut to feel the seal."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are cheap Coleman coolers good?",
    "a": "They are good value for weekend trips. Coleman lists up to 5 days of ice at 90F on these models, though real results depend on use. They do not match rotomolded coolers for toughness."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is wheels worth it?",
    "a": "If you walk more than a short distance with a full load, yes. A full 62 quart cooler is heavy, and wheels save your back. For a short hop from car to site, handles are enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "Soft or hard cooler?",
    "a": "Hard coolers last days and soft ones last hours. For a weekend of food, take a hard cooler. For a beach day or picnic, a light soft bag is easier."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a cooler?",
    "a": "Pre-chill the cooler, fill it with cold items and put ice on top. Keep raw meat at the bottom in sealed containers. Fill any empty space so less warm air sits above the ice."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean it?",
    "a": "Drain it, rinse with mild soapy water and dry it with the lid open. A splash of diluted vinegar helps with odors. Store it with the lid ajar."
