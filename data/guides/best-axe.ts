  },
  {
    "criterion": "Head weight",
    "explanation": "A heavy head such as 4.5 pounds splits stubborn rounds with fewer swings, while lighter heads suit kindling and tire your arms less. Heavy tools are harder to control for new users. Check the head weight on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Handle material",
    "explanation": "Fiberglass handles absorb shock and shrug off weather, which is good for long chopping sessions. Wood feels traditional but can crack. Look for fiberglass or shock-reducing wording and an anti-slip grip."

  {
    "criterion": "Edge and coating",
