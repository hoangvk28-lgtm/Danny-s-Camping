export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watts versus watt-hours",
    "explanation": "Watts measure how much a unit can supply at once, while watt-hours measure how long it can supply it. A 5,120Wh battery with 3,600W output runs a 3,600W load for about an hour. Read both numbers on every listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Peak versus continuous",
    "explanation": "A peak rating covers a brief startup spike, while continuous is what holds up. The ALLPOWERS R2500 V2 lists 5,000W peak but 2,500W continuous. Look for the word rated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "240V output",
    "explanation": "Big appliances such as well pumps use 240V. Check that the listing says 120V and 240V, as the Jackery 5000 Plus does. Skip it if all your loads are 120V."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input",
    "explanation": "Maximum solar input in watts sets the fastest refill. A 1,000W input is enough for a long day, and 4,000W is faster. Match panel voltage to the station."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch",
    "explanation": "A house panel can only be fed through an approved transfer switch or inlet, never through a normal outlet. This protects both the grid workers and your equipment. Ask the maker for the right accessory and use an electrician."

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run a house?",
    "a": "With a transfer switch and proper wiring, the Jackery 5000 Plus is built for it. The others cover essentials only."

  {
    "q": "Is 5,120Wh worth it over 1,920Wh?",
    "a": "For multi-day backup, yes, since stored energy sets the run time. For short outages, the ALLPOWERS R2500 V2 is enough."
