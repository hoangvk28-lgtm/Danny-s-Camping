export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage limits come first",
    "explanation": "A 500W panel often runs at 40 to 56 volts open-circuit, which can exceed a smaller station's solar input limit. Read the station's maximum input voltage and compare it with the panel's Voc. Never connect a panel above the limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real 500W output",
    "explanation": "A 500W panel rarely delivers 500W, with 300 to 400 watts typical in good sun. Check that your station accepts enough input to use it. A station limited to 400W input wastes the extra panel capacity."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size and weight",
    "explanation": "A 500W foldable weighs around 28 pounds and takes real space even when folded. Check the folded dimensions against your trunk. Plan a two-hand carry."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating differences",
    "explanation": "IP67 handles rain and dust, while IP64 protects against splashes and dust. If your camp sees heavy rain, the rating matters. Keep connectors covered either way."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length and adapters",
    "explanation": "A 1.5 m cable forces the station near the panel, while longer cables let you shade the station. Adapters cover XT60, DC and Anderson inputs. Look at the cable list on the listing."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a 500W panel?",
    "a": "Only if your station can take 500W or more of solar input and you want fast daily charging. A 200W to 400W panel handles most weekend trips."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with a 500W panel?",
    "a": "Ignoring the voltage window. The LVYUAN 500W 48V lists a 56.64V Voc, which can exceed some stations. Check the limit before you buy."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the BLUETTI worth the extra cost?",
    "a": "For BLUETTI owners, it is matched and IP67 rated. Others can save with the LVYUAN 500W 48V if the voltage fits."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a large foldable panel?",
    "a": "Unfold it flat on a stable surface, tilt it toward the sun and connect the cable to the station before switching the station on. Weigh down the corners in wind."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I charge a station overnight from solar?",
    "a": "No, solar needs sunlight. Plan daytime charging and use the station at night. A cloud cover lowers output sharply."
