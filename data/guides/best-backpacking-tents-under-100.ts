  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof number",
    "explanation": "A millimeter rating, like the 3000mm on the Night Cat 1-2P, tells how much water pressure fabric resists. 1,000mm is basic, 3000mm is solid for rain. Check the number on both fly and floor."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seams and floor",
    "explanation": "Water gets in at the seams and the floor. Taped seams and a welded or bathtub floor, like on the Night Cat 2P, matter more than a high fabric number. Look for the words taped or welded."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pole material",
    "explanation": "Aluminum poles flex and survive wind, while fiberglass can splinter. Fiberglass is cheaper and heavier. Check the pole material in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed weight",
    "explanation": "A 4.4 pound tent like the Night Cat 1-2P is easy to backpack. Many budget listings skip weight. If missing, assume it is heavy."

  {
    "criterion": "Size honestly",

    "q": "Do I need a footprint?",
