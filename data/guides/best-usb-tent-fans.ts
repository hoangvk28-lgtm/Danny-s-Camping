export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB output and amps",
    "explanation": "A USB port delivers 5 volts at 1 amp for older ports, 2 amps for chargers and more for modern ones. A fan listing 2A needs a source that can supply it. Check your power bank's output label before you buy a corded fan."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Corded or rechargeable",
    "explanation": "A corded fan has no battery to wear out and no runtime limit, but it needs power all night. A rechargeable one charges over USB then runs cord-free. Choose by whether your power source stays with the tent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length",
    "explanation": "A 13 ft cord reaches a car or a lantern power station outside the tent, while a 69-inch cord reaches a bag a few feet away. Measure the distance from your hanging point to the plug. Look for the cord length on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Timers and switches",
    "explanation": "An inline switch is the only control on most corded fans, so a timer is a real upgrade. It protects the power bank from draining overnight. Look for timing adjustment on the product page."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fan size versus tent",
    "explanation": "Sixteen-inch fans suit small and medium tents, while a 9-inch fan covers a bunk. Listings often say if a fan is for small spaces. Treat that as a real limit, not a modest claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Blade removal",
    "explanation": "Detachable blades mean a flatter pack and an easier time in a bin. They also add assembly each setup. Look for the blade count and whether they detach."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I run a tent fan from a phone charger?",
    "a": "Yes, if the charger supplies the 5V and 2A the fan lists. The Roodike draws about 5W and the RITPHI and Mengnessly list 2A USB sources. A weak 1A charger may stall the motor."
  },
  {
    "q": "What happens if the power bank dies overnight?",
    "a": "A corded fan stops at once. The FIALAME has its own battery, so it keeps running. A timer, as on the RITPHI, can cut the draw before the bank is flat."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a USB ceiling fan worth it over a clip-on fan?",
    "a": "If the tent has a high point and you share the space, yes, since overhead air reaches everyone. A clip-on fan suits one person. The corded fans here all hang from hooks."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I route a USB cable out of a tent?",
    "a": "Use a vent, a corner zip gap or a cable port, and keep the cable off walkways so no one trips. A long cord like the Roodike's makes this simple. Keep the connector dry and clear of rain flaps."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a USB fan into a solar panel?",
    "a": "Only through a power bank or a controller that outputs steady 5V. A direct panel connection can fluctuate and stop the motor. A small power bank charged by day works well."
