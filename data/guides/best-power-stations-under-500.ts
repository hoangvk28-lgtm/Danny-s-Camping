  {
    "criterion": "Appliance watts and hours",
    "explanation": "A mini fridge draws about 50 to 100W while running, a CPAP 30 to 60W and a laptop 60W, so 1,000Wh runs them all for 8 to 12 hours. A 1,500W kettle drains it in under half an hour. Look at both watts and watt-hours and add your devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous vs surge",
    "explanation": "A 1,800W station runs a 1,500W coffee maker or a 1,200W microwave, while a 500W station cannot run either, even briefly. Surge watts only cover the short startup peak of motors. Look for the continuous rating in the title and match it to your highest-watt appliance with some headroom."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "LiFePO4 and cycles",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells last 3,000 to 3,500 cycles, which is about 10 years of regular use, compared with 500 to 800 cycles for standard lithium-ion. That gap decides the cost per year if you take the station out every weekend. Look for LiFePO4 or LFP in the description, especially if you will use the station weekly, and treat unspecified chemistry as lithium-ion."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge speed",
    "explanation": "A 500W AC input refills 512Wh in about an hour, while a 100W input needs 6 to 9 hours, which matters on a trip with a short stop. Fast charging is also useful before a storm. Look for the AC input watts and the time to 80 percent in the product details, and compare them with how you will recharge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input",
    "explanation": "A 600W solar input refills 1,056Wh in about 1.8 hours of full sun, while a 100W input takes 6 to 9 hours. Check the maximum solar watts and the voltage range before buying a panel. Look for MPPT and the input limit in the specs."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How long will 1,000Wh run a fridge?",
    "a": "A fridge draws about 50 to 100W while running and cycles on and off, so 1,000Wh lasts 1 to 2 days. The Anker SOLIX C1000 holds 1,056Wh, which covers a weekend. A full-size household fridge draws more at startup, so check its label."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run a microwave on one of these?",
    "a": "A 1,000W microwave needs a station with 1,500W or more continuous, which means the Anker SOLIX C1000 or EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic. The 500W stations cannot run it. Check the microwave input watts on its label first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I size a solar panel?",
    "a": "Match the panel's voltage and watts to the station's solar input. The Anker SOLIX C1000 accepts up to 600W, and the EcoFlow River 2 Pro up to 220W. Charge time is capacity divided by watts."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are these safe indoors?",
    "a": "Battery power stations make no fumes, so you can use them indoors and in tents, unlike gas generators. Keep them dry and ventilated, and never cover the vents. Avoid leaving them in a hot car."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a station for winter?",
    "a": "Charge it to 50 to 80 percent, store it in a cool dry place and top it up every three months. LiFePO4 units such as the ANTPO 512Wh tolerate storage better. Avoid temperatures below freezing during charging."
