  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pack volume versus trip length",
    "explanation": "A 50L pack suits a weekend, 60 to 70L a long weekend, and larger sizes are for extended trips. Bigger packs tempt you to overpack. Check the stated liters and match them to your longest trip."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric strength",
    "explanation": "A 900D Oxford fabric resists scrapes better than 600D. Check the denier rating on the listing. Water resistance still needs a rain cover or liner."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hip belt and shoulder straps",
