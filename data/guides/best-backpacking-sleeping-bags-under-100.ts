export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Honest temperature ratings",
    "explanation": "At this budget, ratings are usually generous and often do not follow a named standard. A comfort range such as 50F to 77F tells you the bag is a summer bag no matter what the limit says. Look for comfort versus limit wording on the listing, and subtract 10 to 15F for a cold sleeper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and compressed size",
    "explanation": "A bag under about 2 lb is realistically ultralight at this price, and a compression sack can shrink it a third more. Heavier bags around 3 lb carry more fill but cost pack room. Look for both packed dimensions and weight in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shape and room",
    "explanation": "Mummy bags hold heat better, while envelope bags give more room to move. Under $100, most bags are envelopes, which feel roomy but leak warmth. Check width and length against your height."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell and fill",
    "explanation": "Ripstop nylon shells resist tears better than basic polyester. Hollow or microfiber fill is usual at this price, and it does not lose warmth when damp the way down does. Look for denier or T numbers and a named fill."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zipper and drafts",
    "explanation": "Cheap zippers snag, and no draft tube means cold leaks along the zip. Look for an anti-snag design or a draft tube mention. A two-way zipper also lets you vent when it is warm."

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do people make with budget bags?",
    "a": "Trusting the limit rating as a comfort rating. A limit of 32F means you survive, not sleep well. Use the comfort number."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Naturehike worth more than the cheapest bag?",
    "a": "If you want room and a lower limit, yes. The Naturehike Envelope also has a compression sack. The cheaper OBTANIM Four-Season is fine for short trips."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a budget bag?",
    "a": "Stuff it into the compression sack from the foot end, then cinch the straps. Do not roll it tight. Pack it near the bottom of the pack."

  {
    "q": "How do I make a summer bag warmer?",
