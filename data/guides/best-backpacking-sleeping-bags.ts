It is cut for campers up to 6 ft 2 in and uses hollow polyester insulation.\n\nAgainst the TETON Trailhead it states a colder rating and adds a longer-lasting draft barrier, so it holds up for later-season trips. The two mummies share a similar shape, and this one carries the colder figure.\n\nIt suits backpackers who start trips in early spring or late fall.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match the rating to your coldest night",
    "explanation": "Think of the lowest temperature you will realistically see and shop for a bag at least 10F colder than that. A 55F bag is a summer bag no matter what the title says. The bullet with the temperature figure is the one to read."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight is usually missing",
    "explanation": "Only some listings print a weight, such as the ECOOPRO at 1.7 lb and the MalloMe at about 3 lb. A missing weight is a gap you have to fill with the brand's site or the product photos. Compare any bag against a target of 3 lb or less for a trail bag."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mummy or envelope",
    "explanation": "A mummy hugs the body and traps heat with less fabric, which is why the Coleman North Rim and TETON Trailhead suit colder trips. An envelope gives space and a zip-flat blanket but carries more air to warm. Pick based on your sleeping position and the lowest temperature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hood and draft tube",
    "explanation": "Heat escapes from the head and the zipper line. A hood you can cinch and a draft tube behind the zipper stop that. Look for both in the feature list on any bag meant for below 40F."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof claims",
    "explanation": "A waterproof or water-resistant shell helps against tent condensation, but it will not keep a soaked bag warm. Treat these claims as light protection and keep the bag in a dry sack. Synthetic fill tolerates moisture better than down."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Compression and storage",
    "explanation": "A compression sack saves pack space but wears insulation if used for storage. Carry the bag in the sack and store it loose at home. Hang loops, as on the TETON Trailhead, make loose storage easy."

];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are warm-weather bags safe for backpacking?",
    "a": "Yes, if you plan trips above 55F and carry a layer. The ECOOPRO lists 1.7 lb and a 55 to 60F range, so it works for summer only."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do first-time backpackers make with ratings?",
    "a": "They read the lowest number as a comfort figure. A 0F bag like the North Rim is a limit-style rating, so comfort sits warmer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Coleman North Rim worth it over the TETON Trailhead?",
    "a": "Only if your trips go below freezing. The TETON Trailhead handles 20F at a similar price and is easier to shop around, while the North Rim adds the colder figure."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a synthetic bag on the trail?",
    "a": "Stuff it without folding into the compression sack, tighten the straps, and keep it at the bottom of the pack in a dry bag. This protects the loft."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a bag clean on long trips?",
    "a": "Wear clean base layers inside, air the bag each morning, and wash it when it is dirty. The MalloMe lists a machine-washable liner and a wipe-clean shell."
