  "A foldable panel with a controller in the box is the shortest path from sunshine to a 12V battery, because the controller sits between the panel and the battery and stops overcharging. All five here pair a panel with a PWM controller, so the choice comes down to wattage, fold and what the controller shows.",
  "Each kit was compared on stated panel wattage, controller type and display, cable length, weight and folded size, and warranty. PWM controllers are simple and cheap, so the guide also explains when the more efficient MPPT type is worth adding yourself."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "PWM versus MPPT",
    "explanation": "A PWM controller pulls the panel voltage down to the battery's, wasting the difference. An MPPT controller converts the extra voltage into amps, often gaining 10 to 30 percent in cool, bright conditions. PWM suits small panels and 12V batteries. Look for the controller type on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match panel to battery",
    "explanation": "A 100W panel in good sun makes about 5 to 6 amps at 12 volts. A 200W panel doubles that. Match the wattage to your battery size and daily draw. Check your battery's amp-hours and use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid, AGM and gel cells need different charge profiles. A lithium (LiFePO4) battery may need a controller with a lithium mode. Look for the battery types the listing names."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Polarity first",
    "explanation": "Clipping alligator clips on the wrong way can damage the controller. Connect the controller to the battery before the panel. Look for reverse polarity protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable and shade",
    "explanation": "A long cable lets you leave the controller and battery in shade while the panel sits in sun. Shade on one corner of a panel can cut output sharply. Check the cable length."

    "a": "Connecting the panel before the battery. Connect the controller to the battery first, then the panel. Check the polarity of the clips."

  {
    "q": "Is MPPT worth it over PWM?",
    "a": "For larger panels and cold, bright conditions, yes. For a 100W panel and a small battery, the PWM controller in the DOKIO 100W Kit is enough."
