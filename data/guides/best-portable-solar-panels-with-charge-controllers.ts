export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "PWM versus MPPT controllers",
    "explanation": "A PWM controller pulls the panel voltage down to the battery's level and wastes the extra, while an MPPT controller converts the surplus into more charging current. The gap matters most when the panel is bigger or the battery is low. Check whether the listing names MPPT outright, as some bundles say smart or intelligent without naming a type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller amp rating",
    "explanation": "A 10A controller can pass about 120W on a 12V battery and a 20A unit about 240W. A panel whose current exceeds the controller rating gets clipped. Add up your panel amps and keep the controller rating above them."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "12V versus 24V systems",
    "explanation": "A 12V kit charges 12V batteries, and a 24V kit expects a 24V battery bank. Connecting the wrong one wastes the panel or fails to charge. Check your battery voltage on its label before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry support",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 batteries want a specific charge profile and a low-temperature cutoff that a basic lead-acid setting may miss. A controller that names LiFePO4, AGM and gel gives you a ready setting. If the listing does not name your chemistry, assume you will need to confirm with the maker."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wiring and polarity safety",
    "explanation": "Alligator clips and Anderson plugs are quick to connect, but reversed polarity can damage a controller. Look for a named reverse-polarity protection and connect the battery first, then the panel. A fuse near the battery adds a safety margin on larger kits."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a separate charge controller with these kits?",
    "a": "No, each kit includes one, which is the point of the list. Match its amp rating to the panel and battery voltage. If you swap in a larger panel later, the controller may become the limit."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with solar kits?",
    "a": "Connecting the panel to the battery in the wrong order or with reversed polarity. Connect the battery to the controller first, then the panel. Follow the polarity colors on the DOKIO 100W Kit clips."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is MPPT worth it over PWM?",
    "a": "On a larger panel or a low battery, MPPT can pull more power from the same sun. For a 20W trickle charger the difference is small. Pay for MPPT when you charge a sizeable bank daily."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set one up?",
    "a": "Place the panel in full sun, connect the battery to the controller, then connect the panel. Use thick enough wire for the length. Confirm the controller light shows charging."
  },
  {
    "q": "What maintenance do these need?",
    "a": "Wipe the panel surface and check the clips and connectors for corrosion each season. Keep the controller dry unless it is listed as waterproof. Store foldable panels in their case."
