export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 3 season means",
    "explanation": "A 3 season tent handles spring, summer and fall: rain, wind and warm nights. It is not built for heavy snow, which needs a stronger pole structure and less mesh. Check the listing for the season label rather than guessing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A rating of 1500mm handles showers, while 3000mm suits heavier rain. Welded or taped seams and a bathtub floor matter as much as the number. Look for the rating and the seam detail on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation and condensation",
    "explanation": "Mesh panels and roof vents let moist air out so the inside stays dry. A fully sealed fly traps breath moisture on cool nights. Look for ceiling vents and a high-low airflow path."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and real room",
    "explanation": "A 2 person label often means two sleeping pads with no gear space. Add one person to the rating for comfort or choose the 3 person Forceatt. Compare floor dimensions rather than the label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight, packed size and setup",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 3 season tent handle snow?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Buying by person count. A 2 person tent fits two pads with no gear room. Size up one person for comfort."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a higher waterproof rating worth it?",
    "a": "For storms, yes. 3000mm on the Forceatt 2-Person 3-4 Season beats the COSMITTO's 1500mm. Seam sealing and a good pitch matter more."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a freestanding tent?",
    "a": "Lay out the body, assemble the poles through the sleeves or clips, raise the frame, stake the corners and attach the fly. Stake the guy lines in wind. Practice at home."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a 3 season tent dry?",
    "a": "Pitch the fly taut, open vents, seal seams and avoid cooking inside. Dry the tent fully before storage. Re-seal seams every few seasons."
