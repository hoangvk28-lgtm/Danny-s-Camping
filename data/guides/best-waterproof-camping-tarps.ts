export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rated coating or plain poly",
    "explanation": "A PU coating has a millimeter rating, while plain polyethylene relies on thickness in mils. A rating gives you a number to compare, and mils do not. Look for the rating or the mil figure in the first lines of the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rip-stop weave",
    "explanation": "Rip-stop fabric has a grid of heavier threads that stops a small tear from spreading. Plain poly can unzip from a puncture. Check for the word rip-stop and for reinforced corners."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Grommet or loop spacing",
    "explanation": "Tie-down points set how tight you can pitch a roof. Wide spacing causes sag and flapping. Look for the spacing, such as every meter, or a loop count like 33."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seams and lamination",
    "explanation": "Seams are where tarps leak, so taped seams or two-sided lamination matter. A cheap sewn seam lets water in. Check for taped, heat-pressed or fully laminated construction."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Intended job",
    "explanation": "A pitched rain fly, a groundsheet and a firewood cover each want a different tarp. Buying the wrong style wastes money. Look at the uses the listing names and match them to yours."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does waterproof tarp mean it never leaks?",
    "a": "No. Even a rated tarp can leak at stitched seams or punctures. Taped or laminated construction lowers the risk. Pitch with a slope so water runs off."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with poly tarps?",
    "a": "Pitching one flat as a roof. Poly sags between grommets and holds water, which can tear the fabric. Tilt it and add ties."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is Gold Armour worth it over poly tarps?",
    "a": "For pitched rain protection, yes, since it lists a rating and many tie-down loops. For covers and groundsheets, the poly sheets cost less. Choose by job."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use a tarp under my tent?",
    "a": "Fold it so it sits inside the tent edge, since overhang channels rain beneath the floor. Poly sheets such as the Vandham work for this. Trim or tuck any excess."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I dry a tarp?",
    "a": "Shake off water and hang it. Poly dries fast, but fold only when dry. Store it loosely out of sun."
