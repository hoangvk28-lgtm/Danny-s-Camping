export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What XT60 is",
    "explanation": "XT60 is a compact yellow connector used on many portable power stations and RC batteries. A panel with MC4 plugs needs an MC4 to XT60 cable, which is an easy add-on. Look for XT60 in the title or bullets, or buy a cable with the panel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the voltage window",
    "explanation": "Every station accepts solar input in a voltage range and an amp limit. Panels above that voltage can shut the input off. Check the input range in your station manual against the panel's volts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match watts to the input",
    "explanation": "A station caps solar input at its rated watts, so a 400W panel into a 200W input wastes the extra. The surplus is not stored for later. Look at the station's maximum solar input before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Polarity and plug direction",
    "explanation": "XT60 plugs are keyed, but cables built with reversed polarity exist. Check positive and negative before connecting. Look for polarity markings on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length and gauge",
    "explanation": "A thin or long cable between panel and station loses power. A 10 gauge cable loses less than 14 gauge at the same length. Check the cable gauge and length when you add an extension."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do all power stations use XT60 connectors?",
    "a": "No. Many use XT60, others use Anderson, DC7909 or DC5521. The MHPOWOS 400W cable covers seven connector types, while the ALLWEI 200W has XT60 and Anderson built in."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake when matching a panel to XT60?",
    "a": "Ignoring the voltage window. A panel that exceeds the station's input voltage may not charge. Check the manual."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the 400W panel worth it over the 200W?",
    "a": "Only if your station accepts 400W. The MHPOWOS 400W costs more, and a lower input limit wastes the extra watts."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up the panel?",
    "a": "Unfold the panel in full sun, set the kickstands, connect the cable to the station and check the input watts. Keep the station in shade."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I add an XT60 cable to any panel?",
    "a": "Yes, if the panel's connector type matches the cable's other end. Check the gauge and length, since long thin cables lose power."
