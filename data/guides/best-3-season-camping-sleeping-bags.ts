  },
  {
    "criterion": "The cold end of the range",
    "explanation": "Three-season does not mean the same thing across brands. The VENTURE 4TH XXL lists 30 to 70F, while the PTEROMY lists 50 to 80F. Check the low end of the range against your coldest night."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bag size and weight",
    "explanation": "A roomy bag is easier to sleep in and heavier to carry. The VENTURE 4TH XXL measures 90 by 39 inches, and the HTMEYBG is 86.6 by 31.5 inches at about 3.3 lb. Read the size and weight lines before you decide."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shell and lining fabric",
    "explanation": "Polyester and nylon shells shed dew, and cotton linings feel softer. The PTEROMY uses a spun cotton lining and the oaskys a 190T pongee lining. Pick the fabric you want against your skin."
  },

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with budget camping bags?",

    "q": "How do I store the bag?",
