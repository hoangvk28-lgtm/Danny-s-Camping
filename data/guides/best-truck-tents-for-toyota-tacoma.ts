export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Model-year range for cap tents",
    "explanation": "A cap tent depends on the shape of the rear opening, so it lists model years. The Dipurman lists 2005 and later. Check your year against the listed range before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bed length",
    "explanation": "Tacomas come in more than one bed length, and a tent made for one will not seat properly in another. Measure from the bulkhead to the closed tailgate. Compare your number with the range quoted in feet on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cap or no cap",
    "explanation": "A bed tent needs the bed open, and a cap tent needs a camper shell with a flat back. Choose by what your truck wears today, since the wrong type simply will not attach. The listing says caps, toppers or shells when a shell is required."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Coating and fabric",
    "explanation": "A PU rating such as PU5000mm describes how much water pressure the coating resists, while fabric weight such as 600D describes toughness. Rain exposure favors the higher PU figure and rough bed edges favor heavier fabric. Look for both numbers in the title or feature list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Setup speed",
    "explanation": "Pole tents can take ten minutes, and a pole-free cap tent can go on in a couple of minutes. Speed matters most when you arrive at camp late or tired. Check the listing for poles, shock cords or a stated setup time."

  },
  {
    "q": "What goes wrong most often?",
    "a": "The wrong model year on a cap tent. The Dipurman Cap Tent lists 2005 and later only. Check your year first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the cap tent worth it?",
    "a": "With a cap, yes, because it goes on in minutes without poles. Without a cap it is useless. The Dipurman Cap Tent costs more than the bed tent."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up the cap tent?",
    "a": "Raise the rear window, lower the tailgate and slip the Dipurman Cap Tent over the opening. Hook the shock cords to the frame. Roll the door panels up for air."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store them?",
    "a": "Dry fully, bag and keep away from heat. Wipe zippers and fold the Qualencey Tacoma Bed Tent poles together. Check seams before the next trip."
