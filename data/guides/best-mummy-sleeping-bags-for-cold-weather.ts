A soft poly-flannel lining, a half-circle mummy-style hood and a stuff sack with heavy-duty straps complete the kit.\n\nOf the two, it carries the colder label, and double-layer construction keeps the fill from shifting. The flannel lining feels warmer to the touch than the BISINNA's pongee liner.\n\nIt suits adults and kids who camp in cold weather and sleep on an insulated pad.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Hood, tube and collar",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "0 degree labels",
    "explanation": "A bag labeled 0 degrees is rarely comfortable at 0. TETON uses the term as a class, and the listing prints no comfort figure. Plan on comfort being 15 to 20 degrees warmer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill and loft",
    "explanation": "Synthetic fill keeps loft when damp, which helps in cold camps with condensation. The TETON names fiber fill, while the BISINNA names none. Check the fill name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "A cold bag is bulky. The BISINNA lists 1.8 kg and 15.7 by 11 inches. Compare against your pack."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad and base layers",
    "explanation": "A sleeping pad often decides the night. Use an insulated pad and wear dry layers. Tips from the TETON listing include a stocking cap and hydration."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Length and fit",
    "explanation": "The BISINNA fits to 6 ft 1. Too short a bag crushes the insulation at the feet. Check the maximum height."
