export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Floor length",
    "explanation": "A 7 ft floor leaves a 6 ft sleeper at the walls. Length is the dimension that matters most in a two-person dome. Look for 86 inches or more if you are tall, and check the floor line in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Peak height",
    "explanation": "A dome peaks in the center and slopes down, so a 43 to 45 inch peak means you sit and crawl. That is fine for sleeping. Check the stated peak height before assuming standing room."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A PU3000 coating handles normal rain while an unrated fabric is a gamble. The rating appears as a PU number in millimeters. Check the title or bullet points for it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fly and ventilation",
    "explanation": "A removable rainfly lets you sleep under mesh on clear nights and add cover when it rains. A double-layer door gives the same effect at the entrance. Look for removable fly and mesh details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pitch method",
    "explanation": "Continuous pole sleeves and clip-on poles cut setup time. A 10 minute setup is fine, but a one-person 3 minute pitch matters when you arrive after dark. Check the listed pitch time."

    "q": "What mistake do two-person dome buyers make?",
    "a": "Buying by width alone. Length decides whether tall sleepers fit. Check the floor length in inches."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Coleman worth over the UNP?",
    "a": "It adds welded corners, a ground vent and a wind rating at a higher cost. The UNP is lighter and simpler. Pick Coleman for wind."
