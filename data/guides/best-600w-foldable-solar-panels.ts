export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage limits",
    "explanation": "A 600W panel typically runs 36 to 44 volts or higher, which may exceed the solar input window of a smaller station. Check the station's maximum input voltage and amp limit. Never connect above them."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real output at 600W",
    "explanation": "Expect 360 to 480 watts in good sun, and less in heat or haze. The station's solar input cap may be lower still. Match panel size to the cap."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and folded size",
    "explanation": "Panels from 22 to 31 pounds are heavy for one hand, and the folded length can be 35 inches. Measure your trunk and the space where you store it. Plan a two-person carry on rough ground."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length",
    "explanation": "A 1.5 m cable pins the station next to the panel, while 4.5 m lets it sit in shade. Check the cable and extension on the listing. Extra length costs a little voltage drop."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather and shade",
