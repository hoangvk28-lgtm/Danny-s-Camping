export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours per dollar",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours (Wh) measure stored energy, so a 999Wh unit runs a 50W fridge for roughly 15 to 18 hours after inverter losses while a 192Wh unit manages about 3. At this price you can find anything from about 0.9 to 3.3 Wh per dollar, which makes this the single best number for comparing value. Divide the Wh figure by the price before you read anything else."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel included or not",
    "explanation": "A kit with a 30W to 60W panel is ready on arrival, while a bare station needs a panel that costs $60 to $150 more. That extra cost can erase the apparent saving, and a 30W panel recovers only about 120Wh on a good day. Add the panel price to the station price, then compare totals."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous AC wattage",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are what the inverter can hold, while surge watts only cover a split second of motor start. A 300W unit handles laptops and a CPAP, a 600W unit adds a small kettle or fan, and a 1000W unit handles a mini-fridge plus a coffee maker in turns. Look for the continuous figure and the number of AC outlets in the product title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry and cycles",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells are typically rated for 3000 or more cycles, while the lithium-ion cells in cheaper units give about 500 to 1000 before capacity fades noticeably. For a weekend user that gap is 8 years versus 2 or 3. Look up the cell type and cycle count, and treat a missing cycle rating as a reason to pick another."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input limits",
    "explanation": "The controller accepts a limited voltage, and a panel above that limit can damage the station. The GRECELL 500W caps input at 23V, which leaves almost no margin for a 100W panel whose open-circuit voltage sits near 22V. Compare the station's maximum input volts and amps with the panel's open-circuit voltage before buying either."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "A 5.84 lb station goes anywhere, while a 17 lb one is a two-hand lift and a 14 lb one sits between. Weight matters most for tent campers who carry gear from a parking area. Read the lb figure and compare it with your longest carry."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I charge these from solar panels I already own?",
    "a": "Yes for the GRECELL and Daran units that accept a panel through an MPPT input, but the panel must stay below the maximum input voltage. For example the GRECELL 500W accepts up to 23V. Check the panel's open-circuit voltage on its label, and use the right connector adapter."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 1000W unit overkill under $300?",
    "a": "Only if you never run a heater, kettle or fridge. The GRECELL 1000W costs about $100 more than the 500W class but doubles the storage, so it covers a second night of CPAP. If your trips are one night, the GRECELL 500W is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are lithium-ion cells a problem for camping?",
    "a": "They are fine for occasional use but wear faster, often to 500 to 1000 cycles. The ZeroKor 60W Kit uses them, which keeps the price low. If you camp every weekend, a LiFePO4 pick like the Daran 600W saves a replacement later."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a power station over winter?",
    "a": "Charge it to about 50 to 80 percent and keep it indoors away from freezing and heat. The GRECELL 500W maker advises recharging every 90 days during storage. Never leave a unit in a hot car, since heat shortens lithium battery life."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run a hair dryer or space heater from these?",
    "a": "No. Hair dryers and heaters draw 1000 to 1800W, above the continuous rating of every pick here, and the GRECELL 1000W would trip at its limit. Use these for fans, lights, laptops, CPAPs and mini-fridges, and use a generator for heaters."
