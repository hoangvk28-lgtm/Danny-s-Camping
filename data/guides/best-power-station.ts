  {
    "criterion": "Output in watts",
    "explanation": "Output is the most a station can supply at once, and a 300W station cannot run a 1,000W heater. Add up the devices you will use together before choosing. Check both continuous and surge watts on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 batteries often list 3,500 to 4,000 charge cycles, far more than older lithium types. That matters if you plan to use the station for many seasons. Look for LiFePO4 or LFP in the product title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carrying",
    "explanation": "A 4 pound station fits a daypack, while a 1,000Wh station needs a firm grip and a trunk. Heavier stations usually hold more power. Check the listed weight and handle design."
  },
  {

    "q": "Can I run a fridge on a power station?",
