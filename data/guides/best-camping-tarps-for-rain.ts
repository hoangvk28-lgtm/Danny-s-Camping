export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Millimeter coating rating",
    "explanation": "This figure shows how much water pressure the coating resists before it leaks, so 3000mm or 5,000mm is stronger than 1500mm. Many listings skip it. Look for the number in the title, the bullets or the spec table."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Seam treatment",
    "explanation": "Sewn seams leave tiny holes that leak without tape or heat sealing. A great coating cannot fix that. Check for taped or heat-sealed seams."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tie-out points",
    "explanation": "More tie-outs let you angle the tarp low to the wind and make a ridge or lean-to. Few points limit your pitch. Look for the number of loops or guy points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Coverage and pitch angle",
    "explanation": "A tarp needs overhang past what you want to cover, and a steep pitch sheds water faster. Compare listed dimensions with your table or sleeping area. Look for feet or inches, not just a size name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric type",
    "explanation": "Ripstop polyester and nylon resist tears that start at a puncture. Denier or T rating hints at weight. Look for the weave, the denier and any reinforced corners."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What rating should a rain tarp have?",
    "a": "Look for at least 3000mm, which the GEERTOP and FREE SOLDIER state, and ideally more, as the Gold Armour's 5,000mm shows. Seam sealing matters as much as the number. Skip tarps with no stated rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common rain tarp mistake?",
    "a": "Pitching it flat. A flat tarp pools water and sags, so set one end low. Keep the angle steep."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Gold Armour worth it over the GEERTOP?",
    "a": "For rating and pitch options, yes. For group coverage, the GEERTOP gives more area. Choose by whether size or rating matters more."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I rig a tarp for rain?",
    "a": "Run a ridgeline between two anchors, drape the tarp and stake out the corners. Angle one side lower. Tension the guylines evenly."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I stop condensation under a tarp?",
    "a": "Leave a gap at the ends so air moves. Avoid sealing the tarp to the ground on all sides. Dry gear outside the sleeping area."
