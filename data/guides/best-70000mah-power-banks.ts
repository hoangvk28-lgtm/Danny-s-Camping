export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Wh matters more than mAh",
    "explanation": "The mAh figure is measured at the cell voltage, so it hides how much energy you are actually carrying. Wh combines voltage and capacity, which makes it the fair comparison between banks. Look for a Wh number on the listing or multiply mAh by 3.7 and divide by 1000."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Output versus capacity",
    "explanation": "A big cell stores energy, while output wattage decides how quickly a device receives it. A 70000mAh bank limited to 22.5W takes many hours to charge a tablet and a phone together. Match the highest port wattage to the device you charge most often."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge time",
    "explanation": "Refilling 260Wh at 18W takes close to a day, while a 100W input does it in a few hours. This matters on short trips where there is no time to leave the bank on a wall charger. Check the listed input wattage before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and portability",
    "explanation": "A 70000mAh bank is a brick that is not easy to fit in a daypack. Heavy units are best used at the tent or vehicle rather than on a trail. Look for weight or size in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Airline limits on big banks",
    "explanation": "Carry-on rules generally cap lithium banks at 100Wh, and some airlines allow up to 160Wh with approval. A 260Wh bank exceeds both limits. Plan on driving to camp, or choose a smaller bank for flights."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is 70000mAh too much for camping?",
    "a": "For a single weekend, a 20000mAh bank often does the job. A 70000mAh unit makes sense for groups, multi-day trips or a laptop. It is a drive-in tool rather than a hiking tool."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a 70000mAh bank go on a plane?",
    "a": "Most airlines cap carry-on banks at 100Wh, and the 260Wh MOVE SPEED and 259Wh JOKO exceed it. Check your airline rules before flying with any bank this size. Driving to camp avoids the issue."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does it take to recharge?",
    "a": "It depends on the input wattage the listing names. A 100W input is far quicker than 18W. Charge it at home the night before a trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these banks have pass-through charging?",
    "a": "Only the MOVE SPEED listing names a pass-through function. Charging a bank while it powers a device is not generally recommended because it adds heat. Check each listing's wording first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a big bank healthy?",
