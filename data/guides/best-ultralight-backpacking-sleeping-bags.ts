    "criterion": "Warmth against weight",
    "explanation": "Light bags use less fill, so they are rated for mild nights. The WERTYCITY lists a 59 degree F comfort figure. Match the bag to your warmest expected night, not your coldest."

  {
    "criterion": "Compressed size",
    "explanation": "Packing volume matters as much as weight in a small pack. The WERTYCITY states 6.9 inches, while the JEAOUIA gives a range. Check the number against your pack's volume."
