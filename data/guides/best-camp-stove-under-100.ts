    "explanation": "A rating of 7,500 to 10,000 BTU boils a liter of water in a few minutes, but higher numbers also use fuel faster. A stove that drinks fuel costs more over a season than the price tag suggests. Check the BTU figure on the listing and match it to your pots."

    "criterion": "Simmer control",
