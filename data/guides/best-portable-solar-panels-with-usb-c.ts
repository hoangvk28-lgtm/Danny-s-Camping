export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C wattage tiers",
    "explanation": "USB-C ports range from 5V 3A (15W) to PD ports at 18W or higher. A phone happily takes 15W, a tablet wants more, and a laptop needs far more than these panels offer. Read the wattage figure on the USB-C line, not the panel's total."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel watts versus port watts",
    "explanation": "A 40W panel does not push 40W through one USB port, since each port has its own cap. Two 18W ports plus a DC port add up to more than the panel can actually produce in cloud. Treat the total as a ceiling shared across ports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cell efficiency",
    "explanation": "Cells quoting 23% to 24% make more power from the same area than older cells. The difference shows up on small panels where area is short. Check the efficiency number next to the cell type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "IP67 means short submersion is survived, while a generic waterproof claim names no test. For camping rain, an IP67 or IP65 rating is a reasonable bar. Look for the code, not the adjective."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Smart charging protection",
    "explanation": "A smart chip that detects the device and caps current protects phones from overcurrent and overvoltage. Panels without it can send unstable voltage to a battery. Look for a named IC or protection list."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a USB-C solar panel charge a laptop?",
    "a": "Not with these. The FlexSolar 40W USB-C Panel tops out at 18W per port and the others are lower. A laptop needs a higher-wattage panel or a power station."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Leaving the phone in direct sun while it charges, which heats it and slows charging. Keep the phone in shade and the panel in the sun. Use the cable length to separate them."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 40W worth it over 15W?",
    "a": "If you charge a tablet or two devices, yes, because 15W is slow. For a single phone, 15W will do over a long day. Pick by device count."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a power bank from it?",
    "a": "Plug the power bank into the USB-C port and angle the panel toward the sun. Charge the bank first, then your devices from the bank in the evening. This smooths out cloud dips."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store it?",
    "a": "Wipe it dry, fold it flat and keep it out of a hot car. Do not crease flexible panels hard. Coil the cable loosely."
