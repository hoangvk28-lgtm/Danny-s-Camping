  {
    "criterion": "Hand cranks",
    "explanation": "A hand crank gives a few watts of effort and a lot of arm work. It is a last-resort feature, not a plan. Look at it as a bonus for a storm kit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wireless charging",
    "explanation": "Magnetic wireless charging is neat but slower and warmer than a cable. It needs a compatible phone or case. Check the wattage and compatibility."
