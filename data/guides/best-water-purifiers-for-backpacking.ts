export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Purifier versus filter",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Press, pump or squeeze",
    "explanation": "A press bottle treats a single serving, while a pump fills several containers. Pick by group size and how much you cook with. Check the printed volume per cycle."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cartridge cost per liter",
    "explanation": "A 250 liter cartridge wears out twelve times faster than a 3,000 liter one, so running costs differ a lot. That matters on long trips and for groups. Compare the stated life in liters and the refill price."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chemical claims",
    "explanation": "Carbon and PFAS claims matter for travel and treated sources, not for streams. Read which chemicals are named. Check that the listing names them."
