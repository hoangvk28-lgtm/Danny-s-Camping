export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "How instant mechanisms differ",
    "explanation": "Instant tents use a lift-pole, a hub, a hydraulic pole or a spring-loaded frame to open quickly. Each mechanism has trade-offs in weight, packed length and wind stability. Read the setup description in the product details, and expect the simpler designs to be the more reliable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A PU rating such as 1500mm measures how much water pressure the fabric resists before leaking. Anything under 1000mm is a sun shelter, while 1500mm handles showers. Look for a number in the title or bullets, and treat tents with no number as fair-weather only."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor size versus person rating",
    "explanation": "A 2-person pop-up typically has a floor around 4.6 to 5 ft wide, which fits two slim pads. Three adults need closer to 6 ft. Measure the pads you plan to use, then compare with the stated dimensions, so write down the pad width you own and add six inches of margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Taped seams",
    "explanation": "Taped seams cover the needle holes made when fabric is sewn, so water cannot wick through them. Without tape, even rated fabric leaks at the stitching. Look for the word taped in the title, and expect it only on a few tents at this price."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed length and weight",
    "explanation": "Hub pop-ups are lighter in the hand but longer in the bag, while lift-pole domes pack shorter. A 40 inch bag may not fit a small trunk or a back seat. Check the packed dimensions and the weight before ordering, because a long hub bag will not fit across a small back seat or a compact car trunk."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are instant tents under $50 any good?",
    "a": "They are good for fair weather and short trips. The anngrowy 2P Pop-Up publishes a PU 1500mm rating, which is the best sign of weather capability in this group. Expect thinner fabric and lighter frames than premium instant tents, and keep expectations modest."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does an instant tent really take?",
    "a": "The Golabs CT3 2P Instant raises in about 60 seconds, and the Mobihome Hub Pop-Up opens in seconds once unrolled. Folding takes longer, especially for hub designs, and the first attempt often takes ten minutes. Practice at home before your first trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use an instant tent in wind?",
    "a": "Only with every corner staked and guy lines attached. Fiberglass frames flex in gusts, and pop-up designs catch wind like a sail. Avoid ridges and open fields, and take the tent down if gusts begin to lift the corners."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I fold a hub pop-up?",
    "a": "Hold the tent upright, press the frame down into a flat circle and twist it into a smaller loop. The Mobihome Hub Pop-Up uses a drawstring to help guide the fold. Slide the folded tent into its bag, and rehearse once before the trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep an instant tent from leaking?",
    "a": "Pitch on a slight rise, stake the rainfly taut and keep the doors zipped. Seal any seam that seeps with seam sealer, and let a footprint or groundsheet protect the floor. Dry the tent fully before packing it away."
