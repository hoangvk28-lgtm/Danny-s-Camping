export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What $75 buys",
    "explanation": "Moving from $50 to $75 buys a recognized brand and a warranty, not more protection. The CICZ 18,000J costs about $50 and the Progressive costs about $52. Decide whether a brand name or a warranty is worth the extra, and spend the difference only if one of those features matters to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joules vs fault warnings",
    "explanation": "A high joule rating absorbs spikes, while a long fault list reports a wiring or voltage problem. Progressive's smart units are lower on joules but longer on warnings. Choose based on whether spikes or bad pedestals worry you more and compare that against the age of the parks you usually visit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Amp service",
    "explanation": "A 30 amp RV uses a three-prong plug and 120V, 3600W service. A 50 amp RV uses a four-prong plug and 120/240V, 12,000W service. Check your RV cord before ordering and then buy a protector with the same amp number so it fits and protects the whole circuit near the cord end, since the label is stamped on the plug."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty",
    "explanation": "A three-year warranty covers a unit that is plugged in and unplugged hundreds of times at weather-exposed pedestals. A one-year warranty is common on budget units. Look for the warranty term in the product details and ask how a claim is made, since some brands need proof of purchase."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP rating",
    "explanation": "IP68 means dust-tight and protected against immersion, which helps in a rainy pedestal. A plain waterproof cover only keeps spray off. Look for the IP rating next to the housing description and remember the plug connection is the weak point, so keep it off standing water."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plug and handle",
    "explanation": "A right-angle plug sits close to the pedestal, and a grip handle helps pull a stiff plug out. These small features matter every time you set up. Look at the images for plug shape and consider where the cord will lie so it is not pulled sideways."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a surge protector stop low voltage?",
    "a": "Not by itself. A plain surge protector absorbs spikes and a smart unit like the Progressive SSP-30XL warns of low voltage. Only an energy management system cuts power on low voltage so an analyzer light does not replace a voltage meter."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 12,000 joules enough?",
    "a": "It is a baseline. Joules are not standardized, and the GEARGO 30A Gen2 at 12,000J is adequate for most campgrounds. Spikes vary, so pair it with an analyzer and watch the pedestal lights each time you plug in."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is Progressive worth the price?",
    "a": "If you value a long-running brand and a long fault list, yes. The Progressive SSP-30XL costs about $52 against about $33 for the GEARGO 30A Gen2. For raw joules the GEARGO wins, so compare the two on fault warnings before you pay."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I read the analyzer lights?",
    "a": "Plug the unit into the pedestal before connecting the RV and read the lights against the chart. A fault means do not connect. The CICZ 50A prints the chart on the case and report a miswired pedestal to the park staff."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a 30A unit on a 50A pedestal?",
    "a": "Only with an adapter, and the 30A unit protects only the 30A circuit. A 30A to 50A adapter can mislead the analyzer. Use a matching unit, so it is better to buy the unit that matches your RV plug."
