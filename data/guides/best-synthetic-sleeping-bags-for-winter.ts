export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A rating you can trust",
    "explanation": "Winter labels are brand figures, so they are optimistic. A 0 degree bag is usually comfortable well above 0. Add a margin of at least 15 degrees and check whether the page names a test standard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill and weight",
    "explanation": "Winter synthetic bags weigh several pounds because fill is the warmth. The Browning lists 122 oz of fill, which explains its 9 lb 9 oz weight. Find the fill weight when the listing prints one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hood and draft control",
    "explanation": "Heat leaves through the face and the zipper. Look for an insulated hood, a draft collar and a zipper draft tube. Check the listing for these parts by name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Moisture and loft",
    "explanation": "Breath moisture builds up inside a bag in freezing nights. Synthetic fill copes better than down, but loft still drops if the bag stays damp. Dry it in the sun when you can."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sleeping pad pairing",
    "explanation": "Fill compresses under you, so the pad provides insulation from the ground. Pair the bag with a pad of high R-value. Check the pad's stated number before you spend more on the bag."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is synthetic good for winter camping?",
    "a": "Yes, because it keeps insulating when damp, which is common in snow. It is heavier and bulkier than down."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a common mistake with winter bags?",
    "a": "Trusting the number on the label. The TETON Altos-S 0 degree figure is the brand's, so plan layers and a warm pad."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Browning Denali worth the weight?",
    "a": "Only for deep cold. At 9 lb 9 oz, it is a bag for a sled, a truck or a hunting camp."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a winter bag?",
    "a": "Loose and uncompressed, hanging or in a large sack. Compressed storage flattens the fill."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I dry a bag in winter?",
    "a": "Turn it inside out in a warm tent or in the sun at midday. A bag that stays damp loses loft and warmth."
