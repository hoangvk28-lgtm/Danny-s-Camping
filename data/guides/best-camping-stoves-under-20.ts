export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Output and boil time",
    "explanation": "Output is stated in watts or BTU, and 3000W is about 10,200 BTU. A 3500W burner boils 1 liter in roughly 3 minutes in calm air, while wind and cold lengthen that time. Look for a stated boil time, and treat figures as best-case results."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel type and adapters",
    "explanation": "Most budget stoves use 7/16 inch threaded canisters in the EN 417 standard, and some include an adapter for 1 lb propane tanks. Alcohol stoves burn denatured alcohol instead of pressurized gas. Check the fuel type in the title and see whether an adapter is in the box, since adapters add $8 or more."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind protection",
    "explanation": "A windshield around the burner can increase boil speed in a breeze, but a shield that wraps a canister can overheat it. Never wrap a windscreen around the fuel canister. Look for a burner with a mesh or shield built in, and place the stove in a sheltered spot."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pot support and stability",
    "explanation": "A stove with a small fire board of 9.5 cm suits a small pot, and a 6.7 inch base holds a percolator. A tall pot on a small base can tip. Match the support diameter to your pot, and use a stable surface, so check the width of the support in the product details before you buy a pot."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ignition and weight",
    "explanation": "Piezo igniters save matches but can fail after repeated use, and a stove without one needs a lighter. Weight ranges from 25 g for a titanium burner to over a pound for a stove with a case. Carry a lighter anyway, and check the weight if you pack the stove."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a camping stove inside a tent?",
    "a": "No. Burning fuel produces carbon monoxide, which can build up and kill without warning. Use any stove outdoors with good airflow, and never inside a tent, vehicle or camper. Carry a battery-powered CO alarm if you cook near a vestibule."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which fuel canister fits these stoves?",
    "a": "Most take 7/16 inch threaded isobutane or butane-propane canisters. The 3500W Windproof Stove and RANDDER Dual Fuel Stove also include adapters for 1 lb propane tanks. Check the thread on your canister before you buy, since fuel is not included."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why is my stove slow in the cold?",
    "a": "Butane loses pressure in cold air, and canisters drop in temperature as they empty. Isobutane-propane blends work better below freezing. Keep the canister in a pocket before use, and set the stove on a flat surface out of the wind."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I light a stove with a piezo igniter?",
    "a": "Open the control valve slightly and press the igniter button until the burner lights. The AOTU Piezo Stove and 3500W Windproof Stove have piezo igniters. If it does not click, use a lighter and check the valve."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a camping stove?",
    "a": "Let it cool, remove the canister and wipe the burner head. Store it in its case in a dry place. The BRS-3000T Titanium Stove packs with a small canister, but keep gas fuel apart from it during travel."
