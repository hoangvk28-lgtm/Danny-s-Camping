The body collapses to 2.44 by 15.7 inches and weighs 1.7 lbs.\n\nIt suits car campers and backpackers who cook, play cards or work after dark and want to aim light where it is needed.

Three brightness levels sit on top of a color temperature that slides from 1800K warm to 6500K cold, and the title lists a magnetic mount and a waterproof body.\n\nIt costs less than the BUBRA and gives up the stand and the multi-head spread. In return it adds the smooth color temperature range, which suits reading, cooking and quiet evenings better than one fixed white.\n\nIt suits campers who want an adjustable warm-to-cold lantern that tucks away, hangs or sticks to metal.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What telescopic really means",
    "explanation": "A telescopic light extends in sections, either as a stand that raises the lamp or as a body that pulls out to open the lantern. A stand changes where the light sits, while a retractable body mostly changes size. Read the listing to see which one you are buying, since both use the word."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Extended height and stability",
    "explanation": "A tripod lifts light above shadows, but a tall thin stand can tip on soft ground. Check that the base spreads wider than the stand is tall and look for a stated height. A lower, wider stance is safer in wind."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery size and runtime",
    "explanation": "Bigger panels draw the battery down fast, so a listing that gives hours at high and at low is more useful than a bare mAh number. A rule of thumb is to plan on the low setting for a whole evening. Compare the high-setting hours between lights."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Brightness and color",
    "explanation": "Lumens measure total light, while color temperature changes the mood. Warm light around 2700K is easier on eyes at camp and attracts fewer insects than cold white. Look for a light that offers both warm and cold settings."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "Most camping lights are used under an awning, yet dew and sudden rain happen. An IPX4 or higher rating means it handles splashes, and no rating means you should treat it as indoor only. Look for the rating in the bullet points, not the marketing title."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a telescopic camping light better than a normal lantern?",
    "a": "It depends on the job. A stand raises light above the table, which helps when cooking or playing cards. A plain lantern is simpler and often tougher, so choose a telescopic light only if you want that height."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake when buying one?",
    "a": "Assuming telescopic means waterproof or tall. Check the listing for a stated height and an IP rating, because neither is guaranteed by the word. The BUBRA Tripod Light names a collapsed size but no weather rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the BUBRA worth it over the Qinzhuo?",
    "a": "If you need real brightness and a stand, yes. The BUBRA Tripod Light lists 3000 lumens across three heads, while the Qinzhuo Retractable Lamp prints no lumen figure. For quiet tent light the cheaper lamp is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a tripod light on uneven ground?",
    "a": "Spread the legs fully and extend the stand only as far as you need. Press the base firmly into the ground and keep heads aimed low in wind. A short, wide stance is steadier than full height."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a rechargeable camping light?",
    "a": "Charge it partway and keep it somewhere cool and dry. Avoid leaving it in a hot car. Top the battery up before each trip so it has a full charge when you need it."
