export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Hex key sizes",
    "explanation": "Most bike bolts use 2 to 8mm hex keys, so a tool covering that range handles nearly every adjustment. A missing 5mm or 6mm size is a common reason for a stuck ride. Check the listed hex sizes against the bolts on your bike."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chain tool support",
    "explanation": "A chain tool pushes out a pin so you can repair a broken chain, and it must match your speed count. Tools that list 8 to 12 speed cover most modern bikes. Check chain tool compatibility on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Spoke wrenches",
    "explanation": "A spoke wrench lets you true a bent wheel well enough to ride home. Sizes vary with spoke type, so a set of several sizes is safer. Check which spoke sizes are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ergonomics",
    "explanation": "Side grips help you apply torque, especially with gloves on or cold hands. Slim tools are compact but harder to hold. Check the grip description and look at the photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and size",

  {
    "q": "How do I use a chain tool?",
