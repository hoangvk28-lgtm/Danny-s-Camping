export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Canister thread and fuel",
    "explanation": "The threaded valve on a canister must match the stove's connection. Listings name the thread, such as 7/16, and the fuel, such as isobutane-propane. A mismatch means the stove will not fit, so read the fuel line before you buy. Buy canisters from the same listing family as the stove if you are unsure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight against fuel use",
    "explanation": "The weight of the stove is only part of the load, because fuel is heavy. A stove that boils faster or uses gas efficiently can save a small canister on a longer trip. Compare any gas-use figure, such as roughly 140 g per hour for the BRS-3000T, against how many days you cook."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pot support and stability",
    "explanation": "A canister stove perches on top of its fuel, so the support spread matters. Narrow supports tip heavy pots, and a remote layout sits lower and steadier. Match the pot you carry to what the listing says the supports hold."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ignition reliability",
    "explanation": "A piezo igniter is a convenience, not a guarantee, because it can fail when wet or after drops. Treat a lighter as a standard backup. If a listing names no igniter, carry one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind and cold behavior",
    "explanation": "Canister output falls when the fuel is cold, and wind steals heat from the flame. A windscreen, a broad burner or a regulator helps. Keep the canister warm before use, and never wrap a canister in a screen that traps heat."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Compatibility with adapters",
    "explanation": "Some stoves list adapters for other tanks. Check that the adapter you need is named and compatible, since the Greenpeak 1 listing says it is not compatible with the Z1 adapter. Do not assume a brand adapter fits across product lines."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do all canister stoves fit all canisters?",
    "a": "No. The valve thread must match, and listings name it, such as 7/16 for the Odoland and isobutane-propane for the MSR. A mismatch cannot be fixed without an adapter, so check the fuel line first."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake with canister stoves?",
    "a": "Overloading small supports with a large pot is the usual one. Keep the pot size within what the listing states, and never run the stove inside a tent because of carbon monoxide."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a remote stove like the Petrel worth it over an upright one?",
    "a": "If you cook in wind or with larger pots, the lower center of gravity and included windscreen help. For simple water boiling, an upright stove such as the BRS-3000T is lighter and cheaper."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I attach the stove to a canister safely?",
    "a": "Make sure the control valve is fully closed, then twist the stove onto the canister until it seats. Open the valve slowly and light outdoors on level ground."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store canisters and stoves?",
    "a": "Keep canisters out of heat and direct sun and store the stove with its valve off. Remove the stove from the canister for travel if the listing advises it, and keep the O-ring clean."
