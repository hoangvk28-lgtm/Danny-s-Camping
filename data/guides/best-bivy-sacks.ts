export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Mylar vs breathable shell",
    "explanation": "A mylar sack is a thin reflective film that traps heat and blocks wind but does not breathe, so sweat condenses inside. A breathable bivy shell is a cover for a sleeping bag. Look at the listing for whether the sack is mylar or a fabric shell, since the two serve different jobs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Length and width",
    "explanation": "A bivy that is too short leaves feet outside and one that is too narrow constricts shoulders. Adults over 6 ft need roughly 84 inches. Check the length and width in inches in the listing, since many only state one pack count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Condensation",
    "explanation": "Without ventilation, body moisture builds up inside a mylar sack and soaks clothing. Leave a gap at the face and dress in dry layers. Look for words about ventilation or a loose head opening."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "Emergency bivies weigh a few ounces and fold smaller than a fist. A listing that gives weight per bag is more useful than one that only gives the pack weight. Check whether the number covers one bag or the whole set."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Durability",
    "explanation": "Mylar is thin and can tear on rocks or sticks. Reusable claims mean careful handling, not rugged use. Put a groundsheet or pad under the bag and check for taped or reinforced seams in the description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Extras that matter",
    "explanation": "A whistle, a drawstring pouch or a head cover can matter in a real emergency. A reflective color helps rescuers spot you. Check the listing for these extras and count them as part of the price comparison."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I sleep in a mylar bivy every night?",
    "a": "They are built for emergencies, not nightly use. They do not breathe, so condensation builds up. The Sierra Madre Bivy is reusable but still thin."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Packing one and never opening it. Practice getting in once at home so you know how it feels. Dress in dry layers first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Leberna worth it over the NovaMedic?",
    "a": "The Leberna adds a whistle, a head cover and a visibility strip for little extra money. Choose it if you will use the kit in a vehicle or on the trail. The NovaMedic suits plain heat retention."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use a mylar bivy sack correctly?",
    "a": "Unroll it, slide in feet first and leave a small gap at the face for air. Put insulation between you and the ground. Pull the head cover on if your bag has one."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a bivy sack?",
    "a": "Fold it along the original creases and keep it in its pouch. Avoid hot cars for months, since heat degrades thin film. Check for tears every season."
