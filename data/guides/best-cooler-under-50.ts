  {
    "criterion": "Stated ice life",
    "explanation": "The Coleman Chiller 30 quart is rated for up to 48 hours, which is a clear, useful number. Many cheap coolers state nothing at all. Look for hours in the listing and be skeptical of vague words like long-lasting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size versus trip",
    "explanation": "A 4 quart cooler is a lunch box, while 30 to 48 quarts fits a weekend for two to four. Count meals and drinks rather than shopping by can count. Do not pay for space you will not fill."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Insulation and elevated base",
    "explanation": "An elevated base keeps the cooler body off hot ground and slows heat transfer. Foam type matters too, as does a double-layer wall. Look for those named features rather than general insulation claims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hard or soft",
    "explanation": "A soft bag is light and collapsible, but its cold lasts hours. A hard chest holds ice for a day or more. Pick by trip length, and consider owning one of each if you often do both."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lid and seat",
    "explanation": "A lid that supports 200 pounds serves as a camp seat, which is useful in a crowd. A weaker lid can crack under weight. Check the stated limit on the listing."
  },

  },
  {
    "q": "What size cooler for $50?",
    "a": "A 30 to 48 quart cooler suits a weekend for a family. Smaller coolers suit lunches and day trips. Do not buy more than you will fill with ice and food."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a soft cooler worth it?",
    "a": "For day trips, yes. It folds away when empty and costs less than a hard chest. For overnight food storage, a hard cooler is safer."

  {
    "q": "How do I keep ice longer?",
    "a": "Pre-chill the cooler, fill it as full as you can and keep it in the shade. Open the lid as little as possible, and pack ice on top of the food."
