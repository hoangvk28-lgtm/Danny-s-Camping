export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Gas versus propane output",
    "explanation": "Propane has less energy per gallon than gasoline, so most dual fuel units list lower rated watts on propane. The WEN DF475T drops from 3,800 to 3,500 running watts and the Westinghouse 4650 from 3,600 to 3,240. Size the generator against the propane figure if propane will be your main fuel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Running watts versus starting watts",
    "explanation": "Running watts are what the generator holds continuously, while starting or surge watts cover a brief spike when a compressor kicks on. A rooftop RV air conditioner can need two to three times its running draw to start. Add up the loads you run together and compare against the running figure, not the headline peak."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outlet type for your rig",
    "explanation": "A travel trailer on 30A uses a TT-30R inlet, and a generator with only a 5-20R duplex needs an adapter. Larger rigs on 50A need a matching 50A outlet. Check the listing for the exact receptacle names."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide safety",
    "explanation": "Every generator produces carbon monoxide, which can collect in tents and campers within minutes. Run the unit outdoors, well away from tents, windows and vents, with the exhaust pointing away. A CO shutdown sensor is a backup, not a reason to place the unit near a sleeping area."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise and campground rules",
    "explanation": "Inverter models like the WEN DF360iX and BILT HARD quote about 58 dBA, while open-frame designs run louder. Many campgrounds limit generator hours and noise, so read the rules before bringing one. Look for a stated dBA figure and the load it applies to."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I run a generator near my tent?",
    "a": "No. Generators produce carbon monoxide and must run outdoors, well away from tents, vehicles, windows and vents. Keep the exhaust pointed away from sleeping areas and place the unit on level ground. Never run one inside a tent, camper or garage."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a dual fuel generator run my RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "A rooftop air conditioner can need a high starting surge, so a unit near 3,500 running watts may handle one but little else at the same time. The bigger units like the WEN DF475T and Westinghouse 4650 Dual have more headroom. Check your air conditioner's running and starting watts before choosing."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is propane better than gasoline for camping?",
    "a": "Propane stores for years without going stale and burns cleaner, so it suits occasional use. It gives fewer watts than gasoline on the same engine. Gasoline gives more power and easier refueling at a station."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I switch between gas and propane?",
    "a": "Most units use a dial or a selector. Connect the propane hose to the tank with the connector, turn the fuel selector and start the engine. Always shut off fuel and let the engine run out of the other fuel before long storage."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a dual fuel generator?",
    "a": "Run the carburetor dry or use a fuel stabilizer for gasoline, and close the propane valve. Store the unit in a dry, ventilated place away from heat sources. Check the oil level before each trip."
