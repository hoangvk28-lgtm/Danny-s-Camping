  {
    "criterion": "Watts per dollar",
    "explanation": "At about $0.57 per watt for the HQST 2x200W and $0.67 for the STAR 990W, the rigid sets beat portable panels at $1.00 per watt. A portable panel costs about 75 percent more per watt but moves with you. Divide the price by the watts before you compare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certification",
    "explanation": "UL 61730 and TÜV certifications show independent safety testing and matter for insurance and permits. Cheap panels often have no listing. Check the certification in the product details, and permits or insurance for a cabin may require a listing such as UL 61730, so ask before you buy because an unlisted panel can be refused by an inspector even when it works well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage and wiring",
    "explanation": "A 24V panel pair wired in series gives 48V, which suits a high-voltage MPPT controller, while parallel wiring keeps 24V and doubles the current. A 12V controller will not accept 48V. Check the controller input limit, so check the open-circuit voltage on a cold morning, when it can rise about 10 to 15 percent above the label, and keep the total under the controller limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and handling",
    "explanation": "A 495W panel weighs 50 lb or more and needs two people to lift it to a roof, while a 200W panel weighs 25 lb. Mounting large panels needs strong brackets. Check the weight before you buy, and a panel of that size catches the wind like a sail, so mounting it on a roof is a job for two people with proper brackets and a calm day."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bifacial gain",
    "explanation": "A bifacial panel adds 10 to 30 percent over a light surface and little over a dark roof. Mount it above gravel or a white membrane for the best gain. Check where the panel will sit, and the back side also needs clearance and airflow, so a panel flat on a dark roof will not collect the extra light the label implies."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller and battery",
    "explanation": "A 990W array at 24V produces 40A, which needs a 60A MPPT controller and a battery bank that can accept the current. That cost is separate from the panels. Check the controller and battery rating, so budget $150 to $300 for the controller and a battery bank, because the panels alone do not make a working system."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much power does 990W of solar make?",
    "a": "About 3 to 4 kWh a day in good sun, enough to run a fridge, lights and a laptop and charge a 3 kWh battery. Shade and angle cut it sharply. Winter output may be a third of that."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need UL certification?",
    "a": "For a permanent home or cabin install, building codes and insurers may require it. For a van or portable use it is not required but is a sign of quality. Check the local rules and it can also lower insurance questions."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use rigid panels with a power station?",
    "a": "Yes, if the voltage and connector match. A rigid panel has MC4 leads and needs an adapter. Check the station's input range and its maximum watts, and a short adapter cable is a cheap fix."
  },
  {
    "q": "What controller do I need for 990W?",
    "a": "A 24V or 48V MPPT controller rated at 40 to 60A. A 12V controller will not handle it. Check the controller's maximum input voltage, and check that it accepts the open-circuit voltage on a cold day."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I mount big panels?",
    "a": "Use aluminum rails and corner mounts rated for the panel's weight and wind load, and seal every roof hole. Two people are needed. Check the panel's wind rating, and check the roof structure first and tilt them in winter."
