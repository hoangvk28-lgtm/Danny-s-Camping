export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What the extra $100 buys",
    "explanation": "Compared with a $200 budget, the extra money buys a complete EGO battery kit or nothing much more in car inverters. The LVYUAN 4000W already costs far less than $300. Treat the cap as headroom, and spend it only if you need a cordless setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cordless vs wired",
    "explanation": "A tool-battery inverter works without a vehicle but is limited by a small pack, while a wired unit draws from a large bank. Calculate watt-hours before you choose: a 4.0Ah 56V pack holds about 224Wh. Check how long your load must run at the rated load rather than hoping for the best."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine vs modified sine",
    "explanation": "Pure sine suits laptops, CPAP machines and variable-speed tools. Modified sine runs resistive loads like a coffee maker well but can make motors hot. Look for the waveform in the product title, and look for the phrase pure sine wave rather than a vague claim of clean power because modified sine is the default for cheaper units."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hardwire and remote",
    "explanation": "A hardwire terminal and wired remote allow a clean installed look and switch the inverter from the cabin. A plug-in unit is easier to move. Check which one your wiring plan needs, and note whether a remote cable is included before you drill or crimp anything."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery bank and cable",
    "explanation": "A 2500W load draws over 200 amps and a 4000W load over 330 at 12V, so cable thickness and fuse size matter more than the inverter. Undersized cable heats up and wastes power. Check the gauge in the manual before you order cables for the load you plan to run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Idle draw",
    "explanation": "Even with nothing plugged in an inverter draws a trickle, and bigger units draw more. That can flatten a battery in days. Use a remote or power switch and shut it off when it is not needed, and a quick test with a meter shows the standby current."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a $250 EGO kit worth it for camping?",
    "a": "It is worth it if you want silent, cordless pure sine power for a laptop and phones and you will reuse the battery in tools. The kit runs only about 224 watt-hours, so it will not run an appliance for long. For heavier loads, the LVYUAN 4000W is better value."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a 4000W inverter run a microwave?",
    "a": "Yes, most home microwaves draw 1000 to 1800 watts, so the LVYUAN 4000W handles one with headroom. Make sure your battery bank can deliver over 150 amps. A small starter battery will sag and shut the inverter down, since voltage sag is the usual reason an inverter trips."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is pure sine worth paying extra for?",
    "a": "For laptops, CPAP machines and any device with a motor, yes. Pure sine costs more per watt but runs cooler and quieter, as the BELTTT 1000W shows. For heaters and kettles, a modified sine unit like the TVNIKD 2500W is fine."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will the EGO battery run a laptop?",
    "a": "A 4.0Ah 56V pack holds around 224 watt-hours, so a 60W laptop could run for roughly three hours allowing for conversion losses. Runtime shrinks with bigger loads. A second pack doubles it, so keep that in mind on a long weekend."
  },
  {
    "q": "What fuse do I need for a 4000W inverter?",
    "a": "Use a fuse or breaker sized by the manual, often around 400 to 500 amps at 12V, close to the battery. Thin cable and weak fusing are the main fire risks. Have it installed carefully, and check the cable gauge matches."
