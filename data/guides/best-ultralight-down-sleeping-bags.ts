export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power",
    "explanation": "Fill power measures loft per ounce, and higher numbers mean more warmth for the same weight. The SENSORY4U states 850. Look for the number on the listing, because it is easy to inflate in marketing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Responsible down",
    "explanation": "Down labels such as RDS tell you the birds were treated humanely. The Naturehike lists RDS-certified goose down. Check for a certification name on the page."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rating or no rating",
    "explanation": "A printed comfort figure helps you plan, even if it is a brand figure. The Naturehike prints none, so use it as a layer. Add a margin to any rating you find."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fragile shells",
    "explanation": "Ultralight shells use thin fabric, such as 10D nylon. They snag on rough ground and bark. Handle them gently and keep sharp gear away."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wet down",
    "explanation": "Down loses loft when it gets wet. Keep it in a waterproof sack and avoid condensation in the tent. Check whether the listing mentions a water-resistant treatment."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is down worth it for ultralight hiking?",
    "a": "Yes, since it offers the most warmth per ounce. It costs more and needs dry handling."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a common mistake with down quilts?",
    "a": "Ignoring drafts. A quilt relies on a snug fit to your pad, so use the straps on the SENSORY4U."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the SENSORY4U worth it over the Naturehike?",
    "a": "If you want a rating and 850 fill power, yes. If you want the lightest roll, the Naturehike wins."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a down quilt?",
    "a": "Stuff it loosely into a dry bag rather than rolling tightly. Compressing it all day flattens the loft."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep down dry?",
    "a": "Use a waterproof stuff sack, avoid condensation and air it out at lunch. Never store it compressed."
