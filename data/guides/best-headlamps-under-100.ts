export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Treat lumen numbers with care",
    "explanation": "A headlamp that lists tens of thousands of lumens is using a marketing number, since small LEDs cannot deliver that. A 1,000 lumen lamp with a beam distance is more meaningful. Compare beam distance and runtime together."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IPX4 versus IPX8",
    "explanation": "IPX4 resists splashes and rain, while IPX8 can be submerged. Camping rarely needs IPX8, but wet trips and kayaking benefit. Check the IP number in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime on each mode",
    "explanation": "Runtime on high is short, while low can last dozens of hours. A lamp that lists runtime for each mode is easier to plan with. Look for hours on high and low."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Headband and tilt",
    "explanation": "A lamp that tilts lets you aim the beam down at your hands. A wide, adjustable band is more comfortable than a thin strap. Check tilt range and band material."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging and power out",
    "explanation": "USB charging is convenient, and a lamp that can also charge a phone is a bonus. A lamp that needs a special cable is useless when you lose it. Check the port type and charge time."
