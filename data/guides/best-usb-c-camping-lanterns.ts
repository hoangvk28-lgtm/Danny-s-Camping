  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity and power bank output",
    "explanation": "A 5000mAh to 7500mAh battery runs a lantern for several nights and can top up a phone. Output drains the lantern. Check whether the listing says power bank or reverse charging."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge time",
    "explanation": "A lantern that fills in 3.5 hours is easy to recharge in a car. Slower charging needs planning. Look for a stated full-charge time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lumens and dimming",
    "explanation": "Peak lumens are a short burst. Stepless dimming or five brightness levels give you control. Check the named modes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "IP54 and IP45 mean protection from splashes and some dust, not submersion. A lantern left in a rainy tent needs at least that much. Look for a stated IP code in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size and hanging",
    "explanation": "A pocket lantern suits backpacks, while a larger one suits a tent ceiling. A hook, handle or diffuser cap decides how it hangs. Check the listed dimensions and hanging hardware before you buy."

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Assuming any USB lantern uses USB-C. Many listings just say USB rechargeable, which can mean micro-USB. Look for the words Type-C or USB-C in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 3000 lumen lantern worth it?",
    "a": "For storm and emergency use, yes. For a tent, a lower mode is plenty, and the Glocusent 135 LED Lantern stays on much longer at low brightness. Match the lumens to the space you light."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge in camp?",
    "a": "Use a USB-C cable from a power bank or car charger. A fill takes about 3.5 hours on the Glocusent models."

    "q": "How do I store a rechargeable lantern?",
