export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Pre-attached versus hydraulic frames",
    "explanation": "Pre-attached poles are thin metal tubes fixed to the tent that you push out and lock, while hydraulic poles lift the roof with a gas strut. Both save time. Pre-attached frames tend to be lighter and hydraulic ones taller, so match the frame to your weight and headroom needs, and look at product photos to see how the poles collapse when folded."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated waterproofing",
    "explanation": "A PU rating of 1200mm handles showers, 3000mm handles steady rain and 3500mm resists sustained storms. Taped seams matter as much as the number. Look for both on the fly and the floor, and compare floor ratings too because wet ground leaks upward, so check that the rating applies to the floor and not just the fly."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity labels",
    "explanation": "A six-person label counts sleeping bags laid side by side with no gear. For comfort, divide by two, which gives three adults and gear. Count air mattresses to plan more accurately, and leave at least two feet of aisle for the door, and picture the bed layout before you buy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solo instant tents",
    "explanation": "A one-person instant tent saves weight and space but cannot fit a partner. Look for a wide bag, double-layer shell and taped seams. Solo designs suit hiking, cycling and festivals, and keep the stakes and footprint with the bag so you never leave them behind."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed size",
    "explanation": "Instant frames pack bulky, so measure your trunk and back seat before ordering. A 42 inch bag fits across most seats, while wide bags need trunk space. Check stated folded dimensions, and remember that long bags need a roof box or rear seat laid flat."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is an instant tent worth $150?",
    "a": "Yes if setup time matters to you. The ADSMART 6P Pre-Attached pitches in about 60 seconds, which beats a 15 minute cabin. For stormy trips, spend on the Mimajor 4P Rain-Ready, which publishes a 3500mm rating, and the faster pitch also reduces wear on the poles."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I pitch a six-person instant tent alone?",
    "a": "You can, but it goes more smoothly with two people. The ADSMART 6P Pre-Attached extends in about a minute once unfolded. Stake the corners first, then extend the frame so the wind cannot carry the tent away."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long do instant tents last?",
    "a": "With care, many seasons. Avoid leaving them in direct sun, dry them before storage and fold them as shown in the instructions. Frame joints and zippers are the usual wear points, so inspect them before each trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does HH 3000mm mean?",
    "a": "It is a hydrostatic head rating. It means the fabric resists 3000mm of water pressure before leaking, which suits steady rain. The Reactive 3 Second 1P states this rating along with taped seams, and higher numbers cost more but resist storms for longer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use an instant tent in snow?",
    "a": "Not unless the maker rates it for snow. Wet snow adds weight that can bend instant frames, and thin fabric collapses under load. Keep these tents for three-season camping and brush off any light snow immediately, which is the usual reason instant tents fail in winter."
