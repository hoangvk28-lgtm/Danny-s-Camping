export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Solar panel size and honest recharge",
    "explanation": "A small solar panel on a lantern is a trickle charger, taking 9 to 24 hours of direct sun for a full charge. It works as a backup, not a primary charger. Check the listing for the stated hours of sun and plan on USB for a reliable top-up."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Collapse versus inflate",
    "explanation": "Collapsible lanterns pull up or stretch from a flat body, while inflatable ones fill with air and sit near paper-thin when packed. Inflatables fold smaller, but pull-up lanterns can hold a larger battery and brighter lights. Look at the listed packed size and weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated lumens against battery size",
    "explanation": "A 65 lumen lantern can run 24 hours from a 1000mAh pack, while 500 lumens will drain a similar pack in hours. Brighter lanterns need bigger cells or AA backup. Find both the lumens and the mAh in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Backup power options",
    "explanation": "Lanterns that accept AA batteries recover when solar and USB are not available. Rechargeable-only models depend on you carrying a power bank. Check whether AA cells are included and whether the lantern can use them for full output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP rating and material",
    "explanation": "IP67 means dust-tight and able to be briefly submerged, while IP65 handles water jets and IPX4 handles splashes. Material matters too, since rubber and TPU survive crushing in a pack. Look for the code and the material in the specs."

  },
  {
    "q": "How long does solar charging take?",
    "a": "The DIBMS 2-Pack lists 9 hours of direct sunlight and the LuminAID Max lists 16 to 20 hours. Cloudy days stretch that, so charge by USB before a trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a collapsible lantern worth it over a rigid lantern?",
    "a": "It saves space and is fine for a tent or table. A rigid lantern holds a bigger battery and gives more output. Pick collapsible when pack size matters."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a collapsible lantern?",
    "a": "Pull or inflate the body until it holds shape, switch it on and hang it from the handle or hook. Put the solar panel facing the sun during the day to top up."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store one for the long term?",
