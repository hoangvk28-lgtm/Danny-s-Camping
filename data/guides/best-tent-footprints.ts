export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Measure the tent floor first",
    "explanation": "A footprint should be a little smaller than the floor, so rain does not run onto it and pool between sheet and tent. Measure the floor, then subtract an inch or two on each side. Look for the dimensions in inches on the listing and match them to your tent's floor plan."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric type and denier",
    "explanation": "Polyester and nylon sheets are rated by denier, where a higher number is a thicker thread, and by T for thread count. A 75D nylon or 210T polyester sheet stands up to rocks, and thin film sheets tear easily. Check the fabric name on the listing, not just the word waterproof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "A millimeter rating such as 1500mm or 3000mm shows how much water the coating withstands before leaking. The higher the number, the more it holds. Look for the number on the listing, since some sheets give none."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "A footprint can weigh from about ten ounces to twenty-two. That matters in a pack or a small car. Compare the listed weight to your tent's own weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Grommets, loops and corners",
    "explanation": "Corner loops or grommets pin the sheet so it stays under the tent. A tent-matched footprint with webbing corners lines up with your tent's own poles. Check that the listing names the attachment type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Brand-matched or generic",
    "explanation": "A footprint made for your tent model fits exactly, while a generic sheet needs trimming or folding. A model-specific sheet costs more but saves guesswork. Compare the listed tent model to yours."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a footprint at all?",
    "a": "A footprint adds a replaceable layer between the tent floor and the ground, which saves the tent's own floor from rocks and wear. It also keeps the underside cleaner. Most campers treat it as cheap insurance for a pricey tent."
  },
  {
    "q": "How big should a tent footprint be?",
    "a": "It should match the floor, or be an inch or two smaller on every side. A sheet that sticks out can funnel rain under the tent. Measure the floor and compare to the listing's dimensions."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a nylon footprint worth it over polyester?",
    "a": "Nylon gives a tighter weave for its weight, as with the OneTigris, and costs a little more. Polyester is fine for most car camping. The weight gap is only a few ounces."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a footprint?",
    "a": "Spread it flat on a cleared patch, then pitch the tent on top and tuck any extra under. Use the grommets or loops to stake it. Smooth out wrinkles that could hold water."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean and store a footprint?",
