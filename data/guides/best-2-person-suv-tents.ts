export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Read the sleeper claim",
    "explanation": "A 2-person label on an SUV tent often means 2 to 3 people squeezed in, or just a shaded sitting area. Look at the interior length and width in the listing and compare them with the size of a standard pad. If the title and bullets disagree on capacity, trust the measurements."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pick tailgate or roof style",
    "explanation": "A tailgate tent keeps the bed on the ground and the price low, while a roof tent lifts you up and costs several times more. Roof tents need a rack rated for the tent weight plus sleepers. Check the load rating of your own rack in the vehicle manual."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the attachment",
    "explanation": "Sleeve and strap attachments grip wheels or a bumper, and hook attachments sit around the hatch opening. A bad match leaves gaps for rain and bugs. Read the fit notes and measure your hatch opening against the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Compare the fabric ratings",
    "explanation": "Higher denier numbers such as 210D and a higher PU number mean more tear and rain margin. A PU2000 tent handles light rain, while 3000mm is the usual mark for steadier showers. Find the figure in the title or feature list rather than assuming."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Think about setup time",

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with tailgate tents?",
    "a": "Buying without measuring the hatch opening and the wheel position. A tent that does not seal around the opening lets in rain and insects. Check the fit notes before ordering."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a roof tent worth the extra money for two people?",
    "a": "It is worth it if you camp often and want to be set up in seconds. For a few trips a year a tailgate tent covers the need at far lower cost. The WGOS Inflatable Roof Tent sits between the two."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a tailgate tent alone?",
    "a": "Back the SUV into place, open the hatch, drape the tent over the opening and secure the straps to the wheels. Stake the corners and raise the poles. Practice once at home before a trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for these tents?",
    "a": "Dry the fabric fully before packing it, since damp storage causes mildew. Shake out sand and dirt and store loosely. Re-seal stressed seams at the start of each season."
