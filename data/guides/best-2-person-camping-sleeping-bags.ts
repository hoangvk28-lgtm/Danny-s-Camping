export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort versus limit",
    "explanation": "A comfort rating is the temperature at which most sleepers will be comfortable, and a limit is the coldest they can stay in. The BORULL Double Queen prints both. When only a design range appears, assume the low end is the limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size for two",
    "explanation": "A double bag needs to fit two adults without shoulders pressed together. The BORULL is 92 by 63 inches, and the oaskys is about 220 by 145 cm. Check the printed dimensions and your combined width."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zipper splitting",
    "explanation": "A true double splits into two singles, which only works if the zippers mate on both sides. Look for the splitting claim, and check zipper direction. Test it at home."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lining and warmth",
    "explanation": "Cotton flannel feels warm and soft but dries slowly if damp. Polyester is quicker to dry. Pick the lining to match how wet your camp gets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "A double bag is bulky, even with a compression sack. Check the carry bag and whether it suits a car or a pack. These bags are for car camping."

    "q": "Can I use a double bag in cold weather?",
    "a": "These bags suit mild weather, with limits near 30 degrees F at best. Add layers and a pad for cooler nights. They are not winter bags."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do two-person bags really split?",
    "a": "The BORULL Double Queen, AGEMORE Flannel Double and oaskys Double Queen XL all say they split into two singles. Check the zipper direction. Test before you go."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a double bag warmer than two singles?",
    "a": "Shared body heat helps, and there is less air per person. A double has more total volume, so the gain is modest. A pad under both of you matters more."
  },
  {
    "q": "What pad do I need?",
    "a": "A pad wide enough for two, or two pads side by side. A gap lets cold air in. Use a connector strap."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wash a double bag?",
    "a": "Check the label, then use a large front-loading machine on gentle. Air dry fully. The flannel-lined AGEMORE takes longer to dry."
