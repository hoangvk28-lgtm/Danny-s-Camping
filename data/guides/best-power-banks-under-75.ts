export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Laptop charging wattage",
    "explanation": "A 14 inch laptop needs 65 to 100W while running and charging, so a 25W or 30W bank only slows the drain. USB-C PD 100W banks like the INIU can charge it, and AC outlets suit laptops with barrel chargers. Check your laptop's charger wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Airline limits",
    "explanation": "Carry-on banks must be under 100Wh, or up to 160Wh with approval. A 25,000mAh bank is about 93Wh and legal, while 70,000mAh is about 259Wh and banned on planes. Check the Wh figure and the airline's rules, and a 70,000mAh bank is banned from planes in both carry-on and checked luggage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity for the weight",
    "explanation": "A 70,000mAh bank holds nearly three times the energy of a 25,000mAh bank but weighs about 1.4 lb and does not fly. Weight matters for hikes, not cars. Check the lb figure, and a bank that weighs 1.4 lb with cables is fine on a car camp but heavy for a daypack."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC outlets",
    "explanation": "An AC outlet lets any plug-in device charge but wastes 10 to 20 percent in conversion and adds weight. A 150W outlet runs a laptop or a camera battery charger, not a kettle. Check the continuous watts, and compare the AC outlet bank with a USB-C bank plus a laptop charger, because a USB-C setup can weigh less."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells in the SinKeu last 3500 cycles, against about 500 for standard lithium-ion banks. For a bank used weekly that is 10 years against 1. Look for the chemistry and the cycle rating, so a LiFePO4 bank costs more now and saves money over a decade of weekend trips."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge speed",
    "explanation": "A 70,000mAh bank needs 10 to 20 hours on a 15W input, which is a night or more. A 25,000mAh bank at 100W takes about 1.5 hours. Check the input wattage and plan the recharge, and if you camp at a site without power, plan to refill the bank at home first."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I charge a laptop from a USB-C bank?",
    "a": "Yes if the bank's PD output meets the laptop's needs. The INIU 25000mAh 100W can charge most laptops at up to 100W, while the 25W and 30W banks only slow the drain. Check the laptop's charger wattage."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why can't I fly with a 70,000mAh bank?",
    "a": "At about 259Wh it exceeds the 160Wh airline maximum, and the LanLuk 70800mAh and Liahomco 70000mAh are both over it. Banks up to 100Wh fly freely and up to 160Wh with approval. Use them for car trips."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does an AC outlet bank do better?",
    "a": "It charges devices that have no USB-C option, such as a camera battery charger or an older laptop brick. The SinKeu 122.8Wh AC Bank offers 150W. It weighs 4 lb, much more than a USB bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I recharge a huge bank?",
    "a": "Use the fastest charger the bank supports, such as 25W to 30W, and plan 10 to 15 hours. Charge it overnight before the trip. A slow charger can take a day and unplug it once the display reads full."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 100W bank worth the money?",
    "a": "If you carry a laptop, yes, because it replaces the laptop charger and lets you charge a phone at once. For phones only, a cheaper bank does the job. The INIU 25000mAh 100W costs about $67, and it can also charge a handheld game console."
