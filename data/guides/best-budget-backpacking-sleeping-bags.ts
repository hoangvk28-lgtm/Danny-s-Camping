export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weight is the budget trap",
    "explanation": "Budget bags can weigh 4 lb or more, which defeats the point of backpacking. Look for a printed weight under 3 lb and a stated packed size. If neither is printed, treat the bag as car-camping gear."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature ranges",
    "explanation": "Most cheap bags start at 50F or 55F for comfort. Only the TETON LEEF lists colder options, in 0, 20 and 30 degree ratings. Pick the rating for your coldest night, and remember a warmer pad lifts the effective range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cut and size",
    "explanation": "Budget bags often come in one size, and 30 inches wide is narrow for broad sleepers. The BORULL lists 79 by 30 inches. Check length and width against your height and shoulder width."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof claims",
    "explanation": "Waterproof shell is a common claim, and it usually means water-resistant. It helps against condensation but does not rescue a soaked bag. Keep the bag in a dry sack."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Washability",
    "explanation": "Budget bags see a lot of use. The MalloMe lists a machine-washable build and a wipe-clean shell. Check the listing for washing instructions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed size and compression",
    "explanation": "A compression sack makes a bag easier to pack but cannot shrink a bulky bag far. Look at the stated packed dimensions. The BORULL packs to 7.9 inches, and the ECOOPRO to 11 inches in height."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a cheap bag work for backpacking?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common budget mistake?",
    "a": "Trusting a title that says cold weather when the bullet lists 50F. Read the range on each listing."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the TETON LEEF worth it over the ECOOPRO?",
    "a": "If you will camp below 50F, yes, because it offers 0, 20 and 30 degree options. For summer trips the ECOOPRO Warm Weather weighs less and costs less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I choose the TETON LEEF option?",
    "a": "Pick the rating at least 10 degrees colder than your coldest expected night. Then choose the size closest to your height."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I extend a budget bag's range?",
    "a": "Add a liner and a warm pad and wear dry base layers. These steps add a few degrees, and they do not turn a summer bag into a winter bag."
