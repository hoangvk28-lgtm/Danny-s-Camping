export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What $200 really buys",
    "explanation": "For the same money you can find mid-tier synthetic or entry-level down bags in specialty stores. Amazon listings tend to cluster far below $100, so a $200 ceiling mostly lets you pick on build and rating rather than price. Check whether the extra budget is better spent on a pad."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Read the temperature numbers",
    "explanation": "A bag labeled 3-season may list a comfort figure above 45F. The Naturehike Envelope lists 59F and 32F, which usually mean comfort and limit. Read both numbers and decide which night you are shopping for."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill type and weight",
    "explanation": "Polycotton fill, as in the OneTigris Bushcrafter, is cheaper and tougher but heavier than synthetic fill. Weight on the Naturehike Envelope is listed at 1.68 lb, while the OneTigris listing prints no weight. Look for a printed weight before you commit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shape and heat",
    "explanation": "Mummy bags use less fabric around the body and hold heat better. Envelope bags give room but let heat escape at the shoulders. Pick shape by the coldest night you plan to see."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zipper and hood quality",
    "explanation": "A snagging zipper ruins a cold night. YKK zippers and a cord-stopped hood, as on the OneTigris Bushcrafter, are signs of finish work. Check the listing for zipper brand and hood description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pad pairing",
    "explanation": "Sleeping bag insulation compresses under your body, so the pad does most of the work from below. A pad with a stated R-value adds more warmth than a pricier bag. Leave some budget for it."

    "q": "Is a $200 backpacking bag a good idea?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What is a common mistake with mild-weather bags?",
    "a": "Assuming the 32F figure is comfortable. The Naturehike Envelope lists 59F and 32F, so treat 59F as the comfortable end and add layers lower."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the OneTigris Bushcrafter worth it over the Naturehike Envelope?",
    "a": "If you want a mummy cut, YKK zippers and a rugged shell, yes. The Naturehike Envelope is lighter and roomier, and it costs less."

    "q": "How should I pack either bag?",
    "a": "Use the included sack and stuff the bag in without folding. Keep it in a dry bag in the pack's lower section."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I extend either bag's range?",
    "a": "Add a liner, sleep in base layers and use a pad with a stated R-value. These steps add a few degrees but do not turn a mild bag into a winter one."
