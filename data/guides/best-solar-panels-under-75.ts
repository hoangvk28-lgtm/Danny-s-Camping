export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "12V or 24V",
    "explanation": "A 12V panel connects to a 12V battery through a simple controller, while a 24V panel needs an MPPT controller to charge a 12V battery. Mixing them is a common mistake. Check the nominal voltage in the title and match your controller, and a 24V string into a 12V controller can overheat it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Frameless design",
    "explanation": "A frameless panel has no raised edge for dust, leaves and snow to collect, so it stays cleaner and sheds snow faster. The glass edges are more exposed, so handle them with care. Look for the panel's weight and thickness, and look for the weight and glass thickness in the specs because thin frameless glass can crack under a falling branch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller included",
    "explanation": "A controller regulates charging and protects the battery, and a kit like the Sanpyl 100W Kit includes one. PWM controllers cost about $15 and MPPT about $40 or more separately. Check the box contents, and a controller rated for less current than the panel produces will overheat on a hot day, so match the amp rating to your panel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Efficiency",
    "explanation": "23 to 25 percent efficiency is normal for modern cells, and a 2 percent difference means about 2W on a 100W panel. It matters more on a small roof than for a camper. Compare the watts and the physical size, so for a limited roof choose the highest-wattage panel that fits and treat efficiency as a tiebreaker."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Foldable or fixed",
    "explanation": "A fixed panel gives more watts per dollar, while a foldable one moves with you. A 30W foldable panel makes about 100Wh a day, and a 100W fixed panel about 300Wh. Decide whether you stay in one place, and the fixed panel is the cheaper way to fill a big battery, so count your daily watt-hours."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty",
    "explanation": "A 5-year product assurance is typical for known brands, and cheaper brands may offer less. Output warranties of 80 percent after 25 years cover cell fade. Check what is covered and who handles claims, so ask about shipping costs for a replacement panel, because a bulky 100W panel can cost $30 to return and a cheap brand may not cover that."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I run a 24V panel on a 12V battery?",
    "a": "Yes, through an MPPT controller that steps the voltage down. A cheap PWM controller will not work well. The STAR 100W Frameless is a 24V panel, so budget for an MPPT controller, and check the controller can accept the panel voltage."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much does a 100W panel make a day?",
    "a": "About 300 to 450Wh on a sunny day with 4 to 5 peak sun hours. That covers lights, phones and a small fan for a day. Shade and angle can cut that in half, and a 200W panel doubles that."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does IP65 mean?",
    "a": "It means the junction box resists water jets, which is fine for rain. IP67 allows brief immersion. Neither protects against a flooded roof, so seal the cable entry and keep the cable connectors off the ground, where puddles collect."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a kit with a controller better for beginners?",
    "a": "Yes, because the Sanpyl 100W Kit includes a controller sized for the panel. You still need a battery and cables. Check the controller's amp rating against the panel, and add fuses between the panel and the battery to protect the wiring in a short circuit."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire two panels?",
    "a": "In parallel to keep the voltage and add the current, or in series to add the voltage. A parallel wiring needs fuses and a bigger controller. Match the wiring to your controller's input limits, and read the panel label for open-circuit voltage first."
