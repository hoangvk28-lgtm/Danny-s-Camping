export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Peak versus running watts",
    "explanation": "The 9,500 peak figure covers a short start surge, while 7,600 running watts is what the unit can hold. Add up your running load, and plan on a margin. Look at the listing for both numbers and the fuel they apply to."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel derating",
    "explanation": "Propane and natural gas usually give lower output than gasoline. The 7,600 figure applies to gasoline in the listings, so assume less on gas fuels. Check the manual for the derated number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "50A outlet and transfer switch",
    "explanation": "A 50A outlet allows connection to a transfer switch or interlock kit for whole-home backup, installed by a qualified electrician. Never connect with a cord that feeds back into a house outlet. Check the outlet list in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "CO shutdown",
    "explanation": "A CO sensor shuts the engine off when carbon monoxide builds up near the unit. It does not replace safe placement, which means outdoors and well away from doors and windows. Look for the CO feature named in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Inverter power and noise",
    "explanation": "Inverter units give clean electricity for electronics and run quieter than open frames at light load. No decibel figure appears in either listing here. Check noise levels yourself before placing it near a campsite."

    "a": "Two 13,500 BTU units can need around 3500 running watts plus start surge. The 7,600 running watts here have room for that, with soft start devices helping."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use it for whole-home backup?",
    "a": "Only through a properly installed transfer switch or interlock kit. The 50A outlet on the DuroMax XP9500iHT is named for that purpose."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is tri-fuel worth it over dual fuel?",
    "a": "It is if you have natural gas at the house, since it removes refueling. Otherwise the dual fuel unit costs less."
  },
  {
    "q": "Where should I run it?",
    "a": "Outdoors, 20 feet or more from doors, windows and tents, with the exhaust pointed away. Never run it in a garage or trailer."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep it ready?",
