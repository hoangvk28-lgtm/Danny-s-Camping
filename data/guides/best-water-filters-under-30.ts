export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What the filter removes",
    "explanation": "A carbon filter reduces chlorine, taste and odor, a sediment filter catches sand and rust, and a scale reducer targets calcium and magnesium. No hose-end filter makes unsafe water safe to drink. Check the title and bullets for which job the filter does, and match it to the problem at the campground."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NSF/ANSI standards",
    "explanation": "NSF/ANSI 42 covers aesthetic effects like chlorine taste and odor, and NSF/ANSI 53 covers health effects such as lead. A filter listed to 53 has been tested to a stricter standard. Look for the specific standard number in the product details, not only the words certified or tested."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Micron rating",
    "explanation": "A 20-micron filter stops sand, silt and rust flakes, while carbon blocks rated around 0.5 micron also catch finer particles and cysts. Lower micron ratings clog faster and slow the flow, which matters on weak campground pressure. Look for the micron figure in the title or bullets, and match it to how muddy or sandy your water usually is."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Filter life",
    "explanation": "A hose-end filter lasts about 1000 to 1500 gallons or a few months of regular use, depending on the water quality. A clogged filter drops flow and can start to taste off, so replace it early rather than late. Look for the rated gallons in the title or bullets and check whether a spare comes in the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hose fit and protection",
    "explanation": "Most RV filters use a standard 3/4 inch garden hose thread, and a flexible hose protector keeps the filter from kinking the hose at the spigot. A rigid filter pulled sideways can crack a spigot or leak at the threads. Look for the thread size in the description and whether a protector is included, since some packs leave it out."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a hose filter make water safe to drink?",
    "a": "No. These filters improve taste and reduce chlorine, sediment or scale, but they are not purifiers. If the water source is questionable, boil it or use a purifier rated for bacteria and viruses. The Camco Tastepure 2-Pack and GLACIER FRESH RV Filter are for treated campground water."
  },
  {
    "q": "How often should I replace an RV hose filter?",
    "a": "Most last 3 to 6 months or about 1000 to 1500 gallons, whichever comes first. The Amazon Basics Inline 2-Pack is rated for 1350 gallons each. Replace a filter sooner if the flow drops or the water starts to taste off."
  },
  {
    "q": "Where do I attach the filter?",
    "a": "Screw it between the spigot and the hose, and then connect the hose to your RV. Use a pressure regulator ahead of it if campground pressure is high, since a filter can burst above about 100 psi. Flush it for a minute before connecting."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a hose filter with a water tank?",
    "a": "Yes. Filter the fill hose so the water entering your tank is cleaner, and sanitize the tank at least once a season. The Camco Tastepure 2-Pack is made for this use. Do not leave the filter pressurized in the sun when not in use."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a hose filter?",
    "a": "Drain it, let it dry completely and store it out of the sun and away from freezing temperatures, since ice can crack the housing. Replace a filter that has sat wet for weeks, because damp carbon can grow mold and smell."
