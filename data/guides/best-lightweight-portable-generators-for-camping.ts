  },
  {
    "criterion": "Running watts",
    "explanation": "Running watts decide what you can power. A 900 watt unit handles lights and a fan, while 1900 watts handles a small appliance. List your loads before picking."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide",
    "explanation": "Engine generators emit carbon monoxide, which can be fatal in a tent or enclosed space. Place them outdoors, far away and downwind. A CO shutdown sensor is a backup, not a license to run them close."
