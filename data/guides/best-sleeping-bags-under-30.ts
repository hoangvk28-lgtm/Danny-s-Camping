export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Comfort vs limit rating",
    "explanation": "A comfort rating is the temperature at which an average sleeper stays warm, while the limit is the coldest point a bag can handle before you get cold. A bag with a comfort rating of 55F and a limit of 40F is a summer bag, not a 40F bag. Look for both numbers and plan on the comfort figure, and add a liner or a layer if the nights fall near the limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Length and width",
    "explanation": "Sleeping bags are cut in lengths such as 83, 86 and 87 inches, and widths from 30 to 34 inches. A bag shorter than your height by a few inches compresses insulation at the feet, and a bag that is too narrow feels tight at the shoulders. Measure your height plus 6 inches for the length and check the shoulder width, especially if you roll over at night."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill and insulation weight",
    "explanation": "Synthetic fill is rated in grams per square meter, and 300GSM is a common figure for a 3-season bag. Higher numbers mean more warmth but also more weight and bulk. Look for the fill weight and a statement of the temperature range, and be wary of a four-season claim at a very low price."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zipper and draft collar",
    "explanation": "A two-way zipper lets you vent the feet, and a draft collar and zipper guard stop cold air from leaking in. These details cost little to add, yet many cheap bags skip them. Look for the draft collar and zipper guard in the feature list, since a bag without them can feel colder than its rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "A 3 lb bag is fine for a car trunk, but a backpacker needs about 1.5 lb or less. Compression sacks cut the packed volume, and the packed size is often printed in inches. Find the packed dimensions and weight before you buy, and compare them with the space in your pack."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What temperature is a $30 sleeping bag good for?",
    "a": "Expect a comfort range around 50 to 60F and a limit near 40F. The TANSTRIDER Adult Bag lists a comfort range of 55 to 60F and a limit of 40F, which is typical of this price. For nights below 40F, add a liner or a pad with more insulation, or step up to a rated 20F bag."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are cheap sleeping bags waterproof?",
    "a": "The shells are water-resistant or wipe-clean, not waterproof. The ECOOPRO Warm Weather Bag has a waterproof nylon shell, yet seams and zippers still let moisture in during heavy rain. Keep any bag inside a tent or under cover."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a rectangular bag better than a mummy at this price?",
    "a": "Rectangular bags give more room and cost less, but they leak more heat than a mummy shape. The budget picks here are rectangular or semi-rectangular, so they suit mild nights. Choose a mummy shape only if you camp in colder weather and accept a snugger fit."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a sleeping bag into its sack?",
    "a": "Stuff the foot of the bag in first and push the rest in without folding, since folding creates permanent creases in the fill. Then pull the compression straps tight. Take it out of the sack as soon as you reach camp so the fill can loft."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I wash a synthetic sleeping bag?",
    "a": "Use a front-loading washer on a gentle cycle with mild soap and tumble dry on low with a few clean tennis balls. The MalloMe Year Round has a machine-washable liner, which helps between full washes. Skip fabric softener and never store the bag compressed."
