  {
    "criterion": "Why a mummy",

  {
    "criterion": "Check the girth",
    "explanation": "A mummy that is too narrow compresses insulation at the shoulders. The Bessport lists shoulder, hip and foot girth. Measure your shoulders and compare."

  {
    "criterion": "Ratings versus titles",
    "explanation": "Titles often promise more than the details. The Bessport title names a 15 to 45F extreme range, and the Wakeman lists both 25F and 10 to 20F. Plan on the warmer number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "Printed weight lets you compare. The Wakeman is 2.98 lb and the Sportneer 4.4 lb. If a listing prints none, as with the SereneLife, expect to measure on arrival."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hood and zipper",
