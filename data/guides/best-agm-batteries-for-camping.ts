  "They were compared on deep-cycle or dual-purpose design, capacity, size, temperature range and warranty. AGM is heavier than lithium and should not be drained below about half, so capacity math matters."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Deep-cycle vs dual-purpose",
    "explanation": "Deep-cycle AGM batteries are built for repeated drain and recharge, while dual-purpose ones also crank engines. A starter-only battery can fail fast under house loads. Check the listing says deep-cycle or dual-purpose."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Usable capacity",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid batteries last longest when drained to no more than about 50 percent. A 100Ah AGM gives roughly 50Ah usable, or 600Wh at 12V. Divide your daily watt-hours by 600 to size a bank."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Group size and weight",
    "explanation": "Group 24, 27 and 31 sizes set the tray fit, and a 100Ah AGM often weighs 60 pounds or more. A battery that does not fit the box or is too heavy to lift is a poor buy. Check physical size and weight before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature range",
    "explanation": "AGM handles cold better than flooded batteries but loses capacity in freezing weather. A stated range such as -4F to 140F helps. Check the listed range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging requirements",
    "explanation": "AGM wants a charger with an AGM profile, and the wrong settings shorten life. Many RV converters can be set. Check the charger voltage specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Series or parallel banks",
    "explanation": "Two 12V batteries in parallel double capacity, and in series double voltage. Use matched batteries and proper fusing. Mismatched banks wear unevenly."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is AGM better than lithium for camping?",
    "a": "AGM costs less up front but is heavier and has less usable capacity. Lithium suits frequent use."

    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with AGM?",
    "a": "Draining it fully. Keep it above half charge for a longer life."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Renogy pack worth it over a single Interstate?",
    "a": "If you want a 200Ah bank, yes. A single Interstate Group 31 AGM suits dual duty."
