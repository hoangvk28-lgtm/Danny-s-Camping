  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "A 1200W surge rating means a brief peak, not steady output. A box rated 600W continuous will cut out under a 1,000W microwave. Check the continuous figure and the surge number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watt hours and microwave use",
    "explanation": "A 1,000W microwave drains 672Wh in about 30 minutes after losses. The 1,024Wh Arkpax lasts closer to 45 minutes at that draw. Divide Wh by watts and subtract roughly 20%."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC outlet count",
    "explanation": "Five AC outlets on the UDPOWER S1200 or four on the Arkpax let many devices run at once, but they share the total. Two outlets limit flexibility. Check the count and total watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge input",
    "explanation": "A 1.5 hour refill needs a high-wattage AC input, such as 800W or 1000W. Standard adapters take much longer. Look for the stated input wattage."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run a microwave on one?",
    "a": "A 1,000W microwave fits within the rating on a true 1200W unit but drains the battery quickly. Plan short use. Check the microwave's input watts, not its cooking watts."
