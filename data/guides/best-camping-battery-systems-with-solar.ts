    "criterion": "Panel versus battery",
    "explanation": "A 60W panel fills 237Wh over roughly a full sunny day, and a 100W panel needs much longer for 1,070Wh. Divide watt-hours by real panel output for a refill estimate. Add panels if the station accepts more."

    "criterion": "Chemistry",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 batteries last for thousands of cycles and tolerate heat well. Lithium-ion packs are lighter but usually have fewer cycles. Check the listing for a cycle rating."
