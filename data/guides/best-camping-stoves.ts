  },
  {
    "criterion": "Burner count",
    "explanation": "Two burners let you cook a pot and a pan at the same time, which speeds up dinner. One burner is enough for couples who cook one dish at a time. Count the dishes you usually make before choosing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind protection",
    "explanation": "Wind steals heat and wastes fuel, so a stove with panels cooks faster outdoors. Built-in guards beat loose screens. Look in the listing for wind panels or a windscreen."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Regulator and ignition",
    "explanation": "An adjustable regulator lets you control flame strength, and piezo ignition lights the burner without matches. High-pressure stoves rely on the regulator hose. Look for the regulator type and ignition details on the product page."

  {
    "q": "Is a high-BTU stove worth it?",

  },
