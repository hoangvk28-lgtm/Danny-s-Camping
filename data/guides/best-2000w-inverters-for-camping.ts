export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are the steady load the inverter can feed, and surge watts are the brief spike it can cover for motor starts. A fridge compressor or pump can need several times its running watts for a moment. Check both numbers, and note that the Ampeak lists 6000W while most list 4000W."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure versus modified sine wave",
    "explanation": "Pure sine wave is clean power that suits electronics, motors and medical gear, while modified sine is choppier and can cause buzz or heat. This affects what you can safely plug in. Look for the waveform in the listing, since one pick here does not state it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery bank and cable sizing",
    "explanation": "At 12 volts, 2000 watts means about 170 amps, which needs thick cable, a fuse near the battery and a bank that can deliver the current. Undersized wire can overheat. Check the maker's cable and fuse guidance, and run the shortest cable you can."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outlet type and 12V socket limits",
    "explanation": "A vehicle's 12V accessory socket is usually limited to about 150 watts, so a 2000W inverter must connect directly to the battery. Plugging it into the socket risks a blown fuse or worse. Look for battery clamps or terminals in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote and hardwire terminals",
    "explanation": "A wired remote lets you switch the inverter from inside the camper, and a hardwire terminal supports heavy loads without a plug. These matter for permanent installs. Compare the remote cable lengths and terminal ratings in the listings."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation and battery drain",
    "explanation": "Inverters create heat and draw idle power even with nothing plugged in. A closed cabinet shortens life, and a lead-acid battery should not be run flat. Choose lithium with a BMS where possible, mount in a ventilated spot and turn the unit off when idle."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a 2000W inverter into my vehicle's 12V socket?",
    "a": "No. A 12V accessory socket is typically limited to about 150 watts, so 2000W units connect straight to the battery with fused cable."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with 2000W inverters?",
    "a": "Undersized cable and no fuse. At 12V the current is roughly 170 amps, so use thick cable and a fuse close to the battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is pure sine worth it over modified sine?",
    "a": "For motors, medical gear and sensitive electronics, yes. EGSCATEE 2000W is fine for chargers and lights, but Ampeak 2000W suits fridges and pumps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a 2000W inverter?",
    "a": "Mount it in a ventilated spot, wire it with short thick cable and fit a fuse near the battery. Connect with the unit switched off and double-check polarity."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain a camping inverter?",
    "a": "Keep vents clear, check terminals for heat discoloration and turn the unit off when idle. Store it dry and inspect the cable ends each season."
