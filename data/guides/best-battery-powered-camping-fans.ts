export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Battery type and capacity",
    "explanation": "Camping fans use a built-in lithium pack measured in mAh, or replaceable D cells. A pack of 20,000mAh or more usually carries a tent through a long weekend, while D cells give instant restart but add weight and cost. Read the title and first bullet for the exact mAh figure or the cell count, and note that D cells are rarely included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime at your speed",
    "explanation": "Runtime figures on listings are almost always for the lowest setting, and high speed can cut them to a fraction. A fan listed as 15 hours on high and 48 hours on low is far more useful than one that only quotes a single maximum. Find the speed-specific numbers in the product details and plan around the speed you will actually use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise on the lowest speed",
    "explanation": "A fan that sounds like a hair dryer will keep you awake, so the low setting matters most. Look for a decibel figure on the first speed, and treat anything near 30 to 45dB as a quiet, sleepable range. A listing with no decibel figure leaves you guessing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hanging versus standing",
    "explanation": "A hook or a stand decides where the fan can live. Dome tents with a loop at the peak work well with hooks, while screen houses may need a clamp or a ceiling bar. Check that the hook is built in and note the weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging method and output",
    "explanation": "Type-C charging is quick and uses cables you probably already carry, while older micro-USB takes longer. Some fans also output power to a phone, which helps in an emergency but drains the pack. Look for the input amp rating and any stated output port."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a battery fan run all night in a tent?",
    "a": "Yes, if the low-speed runtime is long enough. The Warmco D4 Fan lists 48 hours on low, so a single charge easily covers a weekend. Check the speed-specific hours rather than the headline number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with these fans?",
    "a": "Buying on the biggest mAh number alone. Runtime depends on speed, and a high setting can drain a pack in a fraction of the low-speed time. Read the hours at the speed you will use."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a rechargeable fan better than a D-cell fan?",
    "a": "For most trips, yes. A rechargeable like the FRIZCOL 24000mAh Fan gives long runtimes without buying cells, while the Gazeled D-Cell Fan is better as a backup. D cells are heavy and not included."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge them in the field?",
    "a": "Most rechargeable fans take a USB cable, so a power bank or car charger works. The ROSHOPI 3-in-1 Fan uses 2A Type-C fast charging. Use a 5V adapter that matches the input rating on the listing."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep the fan working long term?",
    "a": "Store it partially charged and top it up every few months. Wipe the blades free of dust and keep the unit dry. Avoid leaving the pack fully drained in a hot car."
