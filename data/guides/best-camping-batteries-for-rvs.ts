  {
    "criterion": "Bolt-in vs plug-in",
    "explanation": "A bolt-in battery feeds the RV's 12V system and lights, while a plug-in power station feeds outlets. They are not interchangeable without wiring. Decide which route your rig and loads use."

    "criterion": "Usable capacity",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid should be drained only to about half, while LFP can usually go deeper. Check the stated depth of discharge. A 100Ah AGM gives about 50Ah in practice."
