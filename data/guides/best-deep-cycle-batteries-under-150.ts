export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and usable energy",
    "explanation": "A 12V 100Ah battery stores about 1280Wh, and lithium lets you use nearly all of it while lead-acid is best kept above 50 percent. That is why a 100Ah lithium behaves like a 200Ah lead-acid battery. Check the amp-hour rating and the recommended discharge depth in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lithium vs AGM vs gel",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 weighs about a third as much and lasts thousands of cycles, but needs a lithium-compatible charger. AGM and gel are cheaper per unit and charge with any quality lead-acid charger, though they last hundreds of cycles. Check which chemistry your charger and solar controller support."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cycle life and depth of discharge",
    "explanation": "Cycle life depends on how deeply you drain the battery. A lithium battery might promise 4000 cycles at 100 percent depth, while a typical AGM manages 300 to 500 at 50 percent. Look for the depth of discharge next to any cycle claim, because a claim without that number is not comparable between listings."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and size",
    "explanation": "A 100Ah lithium weighs 24 lb, while a 100Ah lead-acid weighs 60 lb or more. Weight matters in a small camper, a canoe or a hand-carried battery box. Check the case dimensions against your tray before you order, and allow for terminals and cable clearance on top of the case so the battery sits tight and does not slide on rough roads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger compatibility",
    "explanation": "A lithium battery needs a charger with a lithium profile at roughly 14.4 to 14.6V, and a gel battery needs a lower gel setting. A mismatch can shorten the life. Check what your charger or solar controller lists before buying or consult the charger manual, since a wrong profile can shorten the life of the cells."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold weather charging",
    "explanation": "Lithium cells should not be charged below freezing unless the battery has built-in low-temperature protection. Lead-acid tolerates cold charging but loses capacity. Look for a low-temperature cutoff if you camp in winter and read the specifications for a stated low-temperature cutoff since lithium cells can be damaged by charging when frozen."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a car charger on a lithium battery?",
    "a": "Not safely, because most car and lead-acid chargers use a profile that does not match LiFePO4. Use a charger with a lithium setting, usually 14.4 to 14.6V. The 100Ah LiFePO4 Group 31 and Feuruetc 50Ah LiFePO4 both need one."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will a 100Ah battery run a fridge?",
    "a": "A 12V compressor fridge averages about 40 to 60 watt-hours a day in mild weather, so a 100Ah lithium holds well over a day of fridge use. Weather, door openings and a poor seal all change the number. Check the fridge's rated amp draw."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is lithium worth it over AGM at this price?",
    "a": "Yes in most cases, because the 100Ah LiFePO4 Group 31 costs about the same as the ExpertPower 55Ah Gel and stores nearly twice as much. It also weighs far less. AGM is only better if your charger cannot be changed."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a deep cycle battery safely?",
    "a": "Use a fuse close to the positive terminal and cable thick enough for the load. Connect the positive first and the negative last, and keep terminals tight. A smart BMS protects a lithium battery, but a fuse protects the wiring."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a battery over winter?",
    "a": "Charge lead-acid batteries fully and top them up every few months, since the VEVOR 40Ah AGM and Interstate 35Ah AGM self-discharge. Store lithium at roughly half charge in a cool, dry place. Disconnect any loads."
