The shell is 20D ripstop nylon with a YKK anti-snag zipper, and the listing gives a contoured hood with a face draft collar.\n\nAgainst the TETON Altos-S, it is the only pick that names its fill, its fill weight and its shell fabric, which makes the warmth claim easy to weigh. The insulated draft tube and 3D foot box are the features that cut heat loss on a cold ridge.\n\nA strong match for backpackers who want a literal 10 degree down bag without paying for an ultralight brand.

The shell is described as water resistant, and a compression sack comes in the box.\n\nIt trades the named down fill of the ZOOOBELIVES for a roomier cut, so side sleepers and anyone who feels boxed in by a narrow mummy get more space to move. The label sits colder than 10 degrees, which gives a margin on borderline nights.\n\nGood for cold-weather hikers who want hood warmth without a tight squeeze.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What a 10F label means",
    "explanation": "A bag labeled 10 degree is usually a lower-limit figure, the temperature where a sleeper can survive curled up, not where they stay comfortable. Comfort often sits 10 to 20 degrees warmer. Look for an ISO or EN comfort figure in the listing, and if it is absent, plan for a warmer night than the label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Down versus synthetic fill",
    "explanation": "Down gives more warmth per ounce and packs smaller, while synthetic keeps more of its insulation when damp. For dry cold, down is the lighter choice, and for wet climates synthetic is more forgiving. Check the listing for the fill type by name rather than a vague word such as warm."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill weight and fill power",
    "explanation": "Fill power measures how much space an ounce of down fills, and fill weight tells you how much down is inside. A bag with 35 oz of 550 fill power down is a different animal from one with 20 oz of 800. Look for both numbers, since a high fill power with little fill still sleeps cold."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hood, collar and draft tube",
    "explanation": "Heat leaves a mummy bag mostly through the neck and the zipper line. A drawcord hood, a collar and a draft tube behind the zipper are the three features that block it. Check that the listing names all three, not only the hood."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed size and weight",
    "explanation": "A cold-weather bag is the biggest item in most packs, so its compressed volume sets how large a pack you need. Compare the stated packed dimensions and any printed weight. If neither appears, assume it is heavier than the listing suggests."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 10 degree bag warm enough for winter?",
    "a": "A 10 degree label suits deep-autumn and mild winter nights with a good pad and warm layers. For sustained subfreezing camping, choose a colder bag or add a liner. Treat the rating as a limit, not a comfort promise."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do backpackers make with cold bags?",
    "a": "They skip the sleeping pad. Ground cold travels through compressed insulation, so a pad with a high R-value matters as much as the bag. Pair either bag with an insulated pad for real warmth."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is down worth it over synthetic for backpacking?",
    "a": "Usually yes if you hike in dry cold, because down packs smaller and weighs less. Synthetic costs less and handles damp better. The ZOOOBELIVES is the down pick here, and the TETON is the budget-minded alternative."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I pack a mummy bag on the trail?",
    "a": "Stuff it into the compression sack without rolling, starting from the foot end. Keep it inside a dry bag or pack liner so snow or rain cannot soak it. Do not over-compress it for days at a time."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store the bag at home?",
    "a": "Hang it loose or keep it in a large cotton storage sack. Long-term compression flattens the loft and reduces warmth. Wash only as the care label directs, and hand wash the TETON."
