export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity in plain terms",
    "explanation": "mAh measures how much charge a battery holds, and a typical phone needs around 3,000 to 5,000mAh for a full charge. A 10,000mAh bank refills a phone about two times before conversion losses, and a 50,000mAh bank many more. Divide the pack's mAh by your phone's capacity to estimate charges, and expect somewhat fewer in practice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Output wattage and ports",
    "explanation": "A pack's output decides what it can run at what speed. A 5V/2A port gives 10W, enough for a vest or a phone but too slow for a laptop. Look at the listed wattage on each port, not only the total."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Airline and carry limits",
    "explanation": "Airlines generally limit spare lithium batteries to about 100Wh in carry-on bags, and packs above that need special approval or are not allowed. You can estimate Wh by multiplying mAh by 3.7V and dividing by 1000. Check this before flying with any large bank."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather and heat",
    "explanation": "Camping packs sit in tents, cars and pockets, and heat is a bigger risk than rain. Do not leave a battery in a closed car in the sun, and keep it dry. Look for a stated waterproof rating, and where none is listed, use a pouch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging back up",
    "explanation": "A big bank is useless if it takes a day to refill. Check the stated input wattage on the USB-C port, since 18W in refills far faster than 5V/2A. Plan to charge in the car or from a wall before each trip."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a camping battery pack run a heated vest?",
    "a": "Only if the listing says it is compatible. The HotokGoo 10000mAh Heat Pack is built for 5V heated clothing and lists heat times. The OHOVIV 50000mAh has no such claim, so confirm with the vest maker before relying on it."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with big banks?",
    "a": "Assuming advertised mAh equals usable charge. Conversion and heat losses reduce what you actually get, so plan on less. Also check airline limits before flying with a 50,000mAh pack."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 50,000mAh pack worth it over a 10,000mAh?",
    "a": "For several days off-grid, yes. The OHOVIV 50000mAh holds five times the capacity but is heavier and bulkier. For one night out, the smaller HotokGoo 10000mAh Heat Pack is easier to carry."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge devices from the OHOVIV?",
    "a": "Plug cables into the two USB-A ports or the USB-C port, and watch the LED display for remaining charge. The listing does not name built-in cables, so bring your own. Use the USB-C port for the fastest top-up."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a battery pack between trips?",
    "a": "Keep it partly charged, dry and out of hot cars. Top it up every few months so the cells do not sit empty. Check for swelling or heat before each trip."
