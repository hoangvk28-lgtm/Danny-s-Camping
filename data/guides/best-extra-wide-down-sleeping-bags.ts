A rectangular shape trades the warmth of a mummy for freedom of movement.\n\nIt suits large or restless sleepers who want down insulation without feeling squeezed.

  {
    "criterion": "Rectangular or tapered",
    "explanation": "A rectangle gives room to roll, and a tapered shape holds heat. The HLITMOUT is rectangular and the SYWSKW is tapered. Pick the shape that matches your sleeping style."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill weight",

  },

    "criterion": "Fill power",
