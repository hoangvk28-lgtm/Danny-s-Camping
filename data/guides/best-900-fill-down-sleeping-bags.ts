  {

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power versus fill weight",
    "explanation": "A bag with 900 fill and little down can sleep colder than a 650 bag with more. The rating tells you the total warmth. Treat fill power as a weight-saving number."

  {
    "criterion": "Responsible down certification",
    "explanation": "RDS certification shows how the down was sourced. It is stated on both listings. Look for a named standard on any premium down bag."

    "criterion": "Moisture treatment",
    "explanation": "Hydrophobic treatments help down handle humidity and light moisture. Neither treated down is waterproof. Keep the bag in a dry sack and out of rain."

    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with fill power?",

    "q": "Is the Spark Pro or Parsec better?",
    "a": "The Sea to Summit Spark Pro 15F suits three seasons, and the Therm-a-Rest Parsec 0F suits winter. Pick by the coldest night you plan to face."
