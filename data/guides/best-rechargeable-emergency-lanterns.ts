export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Redundant power sources",
    "explanation": "In a long outage, a lantern that can use solar, USB or AA cells keeps working when one option fails. A USB-only lantern needs a bank or a car. Look for the number of power sources on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lumens versus modes",
    "explanation": "Lumens measure total light, but modes decide how long it lasts. Use low for hours of light and high only for tasks. Check that the lantern dims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery and power bank",
    "explanation": "A lantern that doubles as a power bank can charge a phone, but doing so shortens the light. Check mAh and the output port. Keep phone charging for emergencies."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP rating",
    "explanation": "IP44 handles splashes and rain from any direction, but not submersion. Higher numbers mean more protection. Look for an IP figure rather than a vague word like waterproof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Storage and readiness",
    "explanation": "An emergency lantern needs to be charged when you reach for it. Store it where you can find it, and check it twice a year. Look for a low-battery indicator."

export const faq = [
  {

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Leaving the lantern uncharged for months. Check it before storm season and after long storage. Keep a USB cable with it."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the AYL worth it over the LETMY?",
    "a": "If you want brightness and phone charging, yes. The AYL 1800LM Lantern is brighter, while the LETMY 4-Pack Solar Lanterns offers solar backup."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge the LETMY by solar?",
    "a": "Place the lantern in direct sun with the panel facing the sky. It takes a full sunny day for a good charge. Use USB if clouds roll in."

  {
    "q": "How do I store lanterns?",
    "a": "Charge them partly and keep them dry and cool. Collapse the LETMY lanterns flat. Test them twice a year."
