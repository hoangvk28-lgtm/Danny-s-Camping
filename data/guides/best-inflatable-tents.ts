It has a stove jack and an AC port, and the pump that inflates it ships in the box.\n\nCompared with the GRALIFCARE it is longer and adds a convertible door awning with a pole set, so you get shade without buying a separate canopy. Against the NANJEEN it costs far less while still covering both heat and cold. The awning also gives it a living area outside the sleeping space.\n\nIt is the all-rounder for a couple or small family that wants a glamping-style camp with shade and climate options in one bag.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Hand pump or blower",
    "explanation": "An inflatable tent keeps its shape in one of two ways. Sealed beams are filled once with a hand pump and then hold air, while blower-fed shelters need power to run all the time. This matters because a blower tent is a backyard product and fails at a remote campsite. Check whether the listing says the blower must run continuously."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stove jack and AC port",
    "explanation": "A stove jack is a heat-resistant opening for stovepipe, and an AC port is a flap for a portable air conditioner hose. They let one tent serve winter and summer, but neither supplies the equipment. The jack is only an opening, so you still need a safe stove and clearance. Look for both ports by name by name in the product title or feature list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric weight rating",
    "explanation": "Fabric is described by denier, such as 210D or 420D, and by a waterproof rating like PU3000mm. Higher denier is heavier and usually tougher, while the number after PU shows how much water pressure it resists. This changes both durability and carry weight. Read both numbers on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real floor and height",
    "explanation": "A stated footprint plus a peak height tells you whether adults can stand and cots fit. Square meters, square feet and per-person claims are not interchangeable. A 12 square meter interior is a very different tent from one labeled for the same number of people. Compare the length and width in feet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carry weight and bulk",
    "explanation": "Air-beam tents are heavy because the beams are thick fabric tubes. One listing here states about 35 kg, which a single person cannot comfortably shoulder far. If you walk from a parking lot, weight matters more than headroom. Look for a weight line before buying."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do inflatable tents need electricity?",
    "a": "Camping air-beam tents such as the WildFinder use a hand pump and then hold their air. Blower-fed party tents like the Easyair need a running blower, so they need power. Always check which type the listing describes."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a stove inside an inflatable tent?",
    "a": "Only if the tent has a stove jack, and even then you need a proper stove, pipe and clearance. Never run a flame inside without a safe setup. Carbon monoxide and fire are real risks."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are inflatable tents worth it over pole tents?",
    "a": "They save setup effort, since there are no poles to thread, and offer big interiors. The cost is weight and a higher price. They suit car camping more than hiking."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does setup take?",
    "a": "Camping listings quote about five to eight minutes with the supplied pump. Party tents quote five or fifteen minutes with a blower. Allow longer the first time."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store an inflatable tent?",
