  {
    "criterion": "Charge time and runtime",
    "explanation": "A lamp that charges in an hour is easy to top up over lunch. A 5 hour charge suits overnight. Compare the listed charge time and runtime on low mode."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight on your head",
    "explanation": "Under 2 ounces is comfortable for all-day wear, and extra weight pulls on the neck. Check the stated weight in ounces or grams. If it is missing, compare the body size."
