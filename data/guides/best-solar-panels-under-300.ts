export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Foldable vs flexible",
    "explanation": "A foldable panel stores in a van and moves with you, while a flexible panel is stuck down for good but fits curves and adds almost no weight. A flexible 300W panel costs $30 to $50 less than a foldable kit. Choose based on whether you need to move it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller included",
    "explanation": "A 12V battery needs a charge controller, and a kit like the DOKIO 300W Kit includes a PWM one. Power stations have their own controller, so a panel plugs straight in. Check what the box includes before buying a second device, and if you buy a bare panel, add $15 to $40 for a controller sized to its amps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Heat and flexible panels",
    "explanation": "A flexible panel stuck flat to a roof cannot shed heat, so output can drop 10 to 15 percent in summer and the cells age faster. An inch of airflow behind a rigid or foldable panel keeps it cooler. Check how the flexible panel is mounted."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Station solar input",
    "explanation": "Many stations accept 100 to 300W of solar and 12 to 28V, so a 300W panel on a 100W limit gives only 100W. Series wiring raises voltage and parallel wiring raises current. Check the station's input range before you buy, so a panel bigger than the limit mostly adds cloudy-day insurance, which is still useful."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and bend",
    "explanation": "A 15 to 18 lb foldable panel is a real carry, while a flexible panel adds only a few pounds to a roof. A 240 to 270 degree bend fits most curved roofs. Check the weight and the bend rating, and a roof with a tight curve may need the greater 270 degree bend, so measure the curve with a flexible ruler."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature range",
    "explanation": "A panel rated from -40 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit survives desert roofs and winter nights. Output falls about 0.3 to 0.4 percent per degree above 77 degrees. Check the temperature rating and the coefficient, so a panel rated to the full -40 to 185 range on a dark desert roof loses power, but it will not fail, and a gap of an inch behind it helps; look for the temperature coefficient in the specs."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much power does a 300W panel make?",
    "a": "About 900 to 1200Wh on a sunny day with 4 to 5 peak sun hours, enough to refill a 1 kWh power station in a day. Shade and angle cut that sharply. Tilt the panel toward the sun for best output."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a 300W panel work with my power station?",
    "a": "Only up to its solar input limit, and only if the voltage fits. The LVYUAN 300W Portable can be wired for 23.6V or 47.2V. Check the station's input range and the connector, and use the right adapter for the plug."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are flexible panels as good as rigid?",
    "a": "They are lighter and fit curves, but they run hotter, lose output faster and are less durable. A 300W flexible panel costs less than a foldable kit. Choose one for a permanent install where weight matters."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a PWM controller?",
    "a": "A PWM controller connects the panel to a 12V battery and prevents overcharging, and the DOKIO 300W Kit includes one. It wastes some power compared with MPPT. For a 300W panel, MPPT gets 10 to 30 percent more."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I mount a flexible panel?",
    "a": "Clean the roof, use the adhesive or bolt through the mounting holes with sealant, and leave an airflow gap if you can. Do not bend it past the rated angle. Seal the cable entry and keep it flat while the adhesive cures."
