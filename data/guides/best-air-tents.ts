export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "How the beams work",
    "explanation": "An air tent holds its shape with inflatable tubes instead of rigid poles. The pump pressurizes the tubes, and the pressure keeps the walls up. Check that the listing names a pump and a repair kit, because a punctured beam needs a patch to stand."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity versus floor size",
    "explanation": "Sleeper counts on air tents stretch quickly. A 2 to 6 person tent with a 6.3 square meter floor fits two comfortably and six only as a squeeze. Compare the footprint in feet against the number of sleeping pads you plan to lay."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric type and rain rating",
    "explanation": "Oxford polyester with a PU coating is rated in millimeters of water column, such as 3000mm, and higher numbers resist more rain. Canvas breathes better but weighs more and costs more. Look for the rating on the listing rather than a vague waterproof claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stove jack and port safety",
    "explanation": "A stove jack is a heat-resistant opening for stovepipe. A tent with one still needs a proper stove, a spark arrestor and clearance from the fabric. Treat the jack as a feature that makes heating possible, not as proof that any stove is safe inside."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and pack size",
    "explanation": "Air beams add pump and tube weight, and a large tent can weigh as much as a small cabin tent. Check the packed dimensions if you load a small car. The listing usually states a carry bag, so look for its size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wind and anchoring",
    "explanation": "Inflatable frames flex in gusts, which helps, but the walls still act like sails. Guy lines and stakes keep a tall tent planted. Look for listed guylines, and plan to stake every corner when winds are forecast."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do air tents need a special pump?",
    "a": "Each tent comes with its own pump, and the listings name hand, electric or auto-stop types. Use the supplied pump so the pressure suits the beams. Overinflating can stress seams."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake with an air tent?",
    "a": "Setting it up on sharp ground without a footprint. A puncture in a beam can sag a wall. Clear sticks and stones first, and keep the repair kit in the bag."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the RBM Panda worth it over the Soboyo?",
    "a": "Only if you want canvas fabric and a roof window. Soboyo Awning Air Tent costs far less, fits more people and adds an awning. Choose the Panda for fabric feel, not for space."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch an air tent alone?",
    "a": "Peg the corners lightly, connect the pump and inflate the beams until firm. Then tension the guylines and stake the rest. The listings for IYGLKD and Fseoot both describe one-person setup."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store an air tent?",
    "a": "Dry it fully, deflate the beams and fold it loosely. Store it in the carry bag away from heat. A damp packed tent can mildew within days."
