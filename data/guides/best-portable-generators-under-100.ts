export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours per dollar",
    "explanation": "A 192Wh unit at about $74 gives roughly 2.6Wh per dollar, while an 89.6Wh unit at about $90 gives about 1. That means a larger battery can last twice as long on a phone and a laptop for less money. Divide the capacity by the price before comparing, and be wary of mAh figures that hide the voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC wattage ceiling",
    "explanation": "A 100W AC outlet runs a laptop charger at 65W and a small fan at 20W, but it trips on a hair dryer at 1200W or a coffee maker at 800W. Even a 150W max rating only helps with brief surges. Add up the wattage of everything you plan to plug in and stay under 80 percent of the rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cell chemistry",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells such as those in the DaranEner last about 3000 cycles, while lithium-ion cells in cheaper units last about 500. For camping 10 weekends a year that is 20 years against 2. Look for the cycle rating on the product page, which matters most if you camp every weekend."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Output types",
    "explanation": "Many camp devices run on 12V DC or USB, which are more efficient than AC because there is no inverter loss. Four DC ports suit routers and pumps, while two USB-C ports at 30W suit phones and tablets. Match the ports to your gear before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size and weight",
    "explanation": "A 2.3 to 3.9 lb station fits a daypack, while the bulkier units need a bag of their own. Weight matters most for flights, where airlines cap lithium batteries at 100Wh in carry-on without approval, so the 88.8Wh and 89.6Wh units can fly and the 192Wh unit cannot. Check airline limits before packing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge options",
    "explanation": "Wall charging takes 1.5 to 3 hours on the fast units and up to 7 to 9 hours on slower ones. Car charging is a good backup, and some stations accept a small solar panel. Check which charging methods are included and what is sold separately."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a $100 generator run a mini-fridge or a CPAP?",
    "a": "Not reliably. A mini-fridge cycles at 40 to 60W, so 192Wh lasts about 3 hours, and a CPAP at 30 to 60W would drain the Akiisolo 192Wh in 3 to 5 hours. Ask your CPAP maker about inverter power, and consider the next price tier for overnight use."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are these safe to use inside a tent?",
    "a": "Battery stations produce no exhaust, so they are safe to use inside a tent, unlike gas generators. Keep them away from sleeping bags and out of direct sun. Never charge one while covered, and unplug it if it feels hot."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I take these on a plane?",
    "a": "Airlines generally allow lithium batteries up to 100Wh in carry-on, which covers the MARBERO 88.8Wh and DaranEner 89.6Wh. The 150Wh and 192Wh units need airline approval or cannot fly. Check the airline's rules before you pack."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a station on a road trip?",
    "a": "Use the car adapter that comes with some units, such as the MARBERO 150Wh. A car socket gives about 10A, so charging takes several hours. Run it only with the engine on to avoid draining the car battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store these when I am not using them?",
    "a": "Keep them about half charged in a cool, dry place, and top them up every three months. Avoid hot cars and freezing garages. A lithium cell left empty for months can fail to recharge and keep them out of direct sun."
