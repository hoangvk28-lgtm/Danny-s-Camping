  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery size and runtime",
    "explanation": "A 4000mAh battery stated at 40 hours on low is easy to plan around. A string with no battery figure leaves you guessing. Read the mAh and the hours at a named brightness."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge time",
    "explanation": "A 2 hour fill suits an afternoon top-up, while 3 to 5 hours needs more planning. Fast charging matters on a weekend. Check the stated charge time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar backup",
    "explanation": "Solar adds an off-grid top-up but takes most of a day. USB-C is the dependable route. Check whether a panel is listed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "IPX4 handles splashes from any direction. A string in a rainy site needs at least that. Look for the IP code."

    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Assuming USB lights use USB-C. Many do not. Read the listing for the port name."

  {
    "q": "Is the BioLite worth the price?",
    "a": "For repeat use, it can be. It states 40 hours on low and has a hub that charges devices. For casual trips, the Zocelight 2-Pack Reels costs far less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a string at camp?",

    "q": "How do I store them?",
    "a": "Wind the cord loosely so the wire is not kinked. Charge the battery partway before storage. Keep the reels dry and cool."
