  },
  {
    "criterion": "AA versus AAA cells",
    "explanation": "AA cells hold more energy than AAA, so an AA lantern lasts longer. AAA suits smaller lanterns. Check the cell type and count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lumens and tent size",
    "explanation": "About 190 lumens lights a small tent, and a family tent needs two lanterns. Lumens matter more than LED count. Check for a lumen figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Collapsed size",
    "explanation": "A lantern that collapses under 4 inches fits a pocket or a glove box. A larger collapsed lantern fits a pack. Check the collapsed size, not the extended size."

  {
    "criterion": "Weather protection",

    "q": "What is the common mistake?",
    "a": "Buying batteries last. Both lanterns need cells that are not included. Pack spares."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 4-pack worth it?",
    "a": "If you camp with family, yes, because one per tent and one for the table is handy. For solo trips, a single lantern is enough."

    "q": "How do I use it?",
    "a": "Pull the top up to switch on and extend. Push down to dim or switch off. Hang it from the tent loop."
