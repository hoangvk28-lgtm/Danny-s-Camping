export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 600W runs",
    "explanation": "A 600W rating covers a fan, a laptop, a car fridge and phone chargers, but not a kettle or heater. Add the watts of everything you plan to run at once. Check the AC outlet rating on the listing, not just the headline number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours decide runtime",
    "explanation": "A 576Wh battery runs a 100W load for roughly five hours before losses, and a 288Wh battery for half that. Divide watt-hours by load watts. Listings that show only mAh need converting at the battery voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel wattage and charging time",
    "explanation": "An 80W panel adds at most 80Wh per hour in perfect sun, so refilling 288Wh takes four to five hours on the listing's own estimate. A 100W panel is faster. Check the panel's watts and the solar input limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "LiFePO4 and cycle life",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells last thousands of cycles and resist heat better than standard lithium-ion. A stated 3,500 or 4,000 cycle rating shows the lifespan. Look for LiFePO4 and a cycle figure in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Outlets and UPS",
    "explanation": "Several AC outlets let you run devices without a power strip, and a UPS switch keeps a router alive in an outage. Count the AC outlets and look for a millisecond figure. A single outlet works for one appliance."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 600W unit run a space heater?",
    "a": "No. Most space heaters draw 1,500W, far above a 600W rating. The 1,200W surge figures only help a motor start for a moment."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the included panel enough?",
    "a": "It tops up slowly. A 100W panel in good sun can add up to 100Wh per hour, so a 576Wh battery needs most of a day."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a kit worth it over a bare station?",
    "a": "Yes if you do not own panels, since the DaranEner 576Wh Kit and Daran 80W Kit work out of the box. If you do own panels, the LIBRIDS C600 gives more storage for less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use the UPS function?",
    "a": "Plug the router or computer into the station and keep the station plugged into the wall. When the power drops, it switches over in about 10ms."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store the battery?",
    "a": "Keep it at partial charge in a cool dry place. Top it up every few months so the cells stay balanced."
