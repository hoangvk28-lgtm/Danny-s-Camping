export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What $30 buys",
    "explanation": "Compared with $20 headlamps, the extra money buys a bigger battery, a motion sensor or real waterproofing, not simply more lumens. Decide whether runtime or water protection matters more. Look at battery size and the IP rating in the details, and remember an extra pair in the pack is often the better use of money than raw brightness."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Beam shape",
    "explanation": "A wide flood beam lights a cooking area but does not travel far, while a spot beam reaches down a trail. A zoom does both. Check for the beam angle, such as 230 degrees, in the product description so the lamp matches the chores you do after dark."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity",
    "explanation": "A 4000mAh battery gives far more minutes than a 1200mAh one at the same brightness. Larger batteries add weight and charge time. Look for the mAh figure in the product details and compare it with the weight, since a larger cell adds grams to your forehead and the lamp, because a big battery on a weak charger takes all night to fill."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproofing",
    "explanation": "IPX5 resists jets of water, IPX4 resists splashes and a waterproof diving lamp can get wet for long periods. Paddlers and anglers need the highest rating. Check the IP rating next to the lamp's name and test a new lamp in a sink before a trip since only a lamp with a high rating survives a kayak dunk."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight for kids",
    "explanation": "A 2.4 oz lamp sits comfortably on a child's head for hours, while a 5 oz lamp can slip. Look for an adjustable ergonomic strap. Check weight in the details and test the strap on a real head if you can since a lamp that slides down is quickly abandoned."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging time",
    "explanation": "A 2.5 hour charge fits an evening, while a 6 hour charge needs a night. Slow charging is a pain between trips. Look for the charge time and the USB port type and plan to plug the lamp in the afternoon before a night out since a dead lamp is no use after sunset."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger battery better?",
    "a": "For long trips, yes. The PINSAI Motion has about 4000mAh while the Everbeam H6 Pro has 1200mAh. A bigger battery adds weight and charge time and the PINSAI Motion makes sense for weekends, while a smaller lamp suits day hikes."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a kids headlamp as an adult?",
    "a": "Yes, the Foxelli Kids is marked for kids and adults and has an adjustable strap. It is light at 2.4 oz. It has lower lumens, so it suits chores, and the Foxelli Kids is a good second lamp for the group."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does a 230 degree beam do?",
    "a": "It lights the sides as well as ahead, which helps with cooking. The Demlaies 2-Pack does this. It does not reach far and how often the chores need long range for example when you stir a pot or set up a tent."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a headlamp dry?",
    "a": "Close the charging port cover and dry the lamp after rain. The Goldengulf Waterproof can be rinsed. Store lamps in a dry bag, and wipe the contacts before charging and leave it open to air before packing."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does a headlamp last?",
    "a": "Years if the battery is cared for. Charge lithium cells every few months in storage. The GearLight S500 2-Pack has USB-C cables and store the lamp at half charge over winter with the cable kept in the same pouch."
