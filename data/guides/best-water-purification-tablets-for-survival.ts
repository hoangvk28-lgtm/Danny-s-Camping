The page claims both bacteria and virus removal, at 99.9999 and 99.99 percent, and says it leaves no iodine-style flavor.\n\nPer tablet it treats a small volume, which suits drinking bottles. Next to the 397mg bottle, it is lighter for a go-bag and easier to ration, and it carries a lower price.\n\nIt suits families building a bug-out or flood kit who want a documented tablet. A hundred strips cover many bottles.",
