export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Fill power versus warmth",
    "explanation": "Fill power measures loft per ounce, so higher numbers give more warmth for less weight. A 750 fill power bag can be lighter than a 550 one at the same rating. Check the fill power on the listing, and prefer a stated number to marketing language."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A bag for summer needs a rating",
    "explanation": "A bag with no printed rating leaves you guessing about 45F pre-dawn lows. A comfort number of 40F tells you where a typical sleeper stays warm. Check whether the listing prints comfort, limit or extreme, and treat missing figures as a reason to bring a layer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Goose versus duck down",
    "explanation": "Goose down generally lofts higher than duck down at the same weight, which helps in ultralight bags. Both can be sustainably sourced if the listing names a standard. Look for RDS or a similar label, and compare the fill power listed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Venting and zipper",
    "explanation": "Summer nights can swing from 65F to 40F before sunrise, so you need to dump heat fast. Dual-direction zippers or a bag that opens flat adds control. Look for those features by name in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pack size and length",
    "explanation": "A short-size ultralight can leave a tall sleeper's feet cold, and a long bag adds weight. Compare the printed length with your height, and check the stuff sack size. Choose the shortest length that fits you."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is down worth it for summer?",
    "a": "If you pack on foot, yes. Down compresses smaller and weighs less than synthetic at the same warmth. For car camping, a synthetic bag costs less and handles humidity better."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do buyers get wrong about summer bags?",
    "a": "They skip a rating and then freeze at dawn. Even in summer, nights near 40F are common at altitude. Check the comfort figure before you buy."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Kelty worth it over the Naturehike bags?",
    "a": "If your summer trips are at altitude, the Kelty Cosmic 20 Down and its ISO figures justify the extra cost. For lower elevations, the Naturehike 40 Degree Down is warm enough for much less."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use an ultralight down bag as a quilt?",
    "a": "The Naturehike CW-EXT Goose Down unfolds into a down blanket, which makes it an easy summer topper. Pair it with a sleeping pad to cover the ground side. Other bags in this list are bags first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for a down bag in humid weather?",
    "a": "Air it every morning and dry it fully before packing. Store it loosely, not compressed, and wash only as the care label allows. Humidity can clump down if it stays damp."
