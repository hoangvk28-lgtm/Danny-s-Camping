export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "UPS switchover time",
    "explanation": "A UPS switchover is how quickly the unit takes over from the wall when power drops. Routers and most PCs ride through about 10 to 20 milliseconds, but very sensitive equipment may need faster. Look for a stated millisecond figure and for pass-through charging."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours and runtime",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours are the battery size, so a 640Wh unit powering 80W of gear lasts roughly 6 to 7 hours after losses. Larger units such as 1152Wh or 2010Wh stretch that into days of light use. Add up your device watts before you choose."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous watts",
    "explanation": "The continuous AC rating is the most the unit can supply at once, and the surge rating is a brief burst. A 600W unit cannot run a space heater, while 1800W covers many kitchen appliances. Check the label against your biggest load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pass-through charging",
    "explanation": "A UPS mode requires the station to charge and discharge at the same time while plugged into the wall. Some units do this only in a specific setting, and heavy use raises heat. Check the manual or listing for the UPS or pass-through setting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry and warranty",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells last for thousands of cycles, which matters for a unit that sits plugged in as a UPS. A longer warranty is a useful signal. Look for both the cycle rating and the warranty term on the listing."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What does UPS mean on a power station?",
    "a": "It means the unit switches to battery power within milliseconds when the wall power drops. Check the listed time, such as 10ms on the BLUETTI Elite 100 V2. It is meant for routers, PCs and small electronics."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the common mistake with UPS stations?",
    "a": "Assuming every large power station has a UPS mode. The Anker SOLIX S2000 listing does not name one, so check before relying on it. Always read the listing for a switch time."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger battery worth it over a faster UPS?",
    "a": "It depends on the outage length you plan for. The BLUETTI AC180 gives longer runtime, while the LIBRIDS C600 gives the fastest switch for the least money. Choose runtime for fridges and speed for computers."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set one up as a UPS?",
    "a": "Plug the station into a wall outlet, then plug your device into the station's AC outlet and turn on the UPS or pass-through setting. Test by unplugging the wall cord briefly. Keep it ventilated."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I leave it plugged in all the time?",
    "a": "Many LiFePO4 stations are built for it, but check the manual for the recommended charge level. Keep the unit cool and dry. Test the switchover every few months."
