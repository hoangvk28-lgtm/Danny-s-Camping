  {
    "criterion": "What ultralight means here",
    "explanation": "No single weight defines ultralight, so use the listed number rather than the word. In this list weights run from about 3 to 5.3 lbs for the pole-equipped tents. Compare the weight stated with and without stakes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Trekking pole versus freestanding",
    "explanation": "A trekking pole tent saves weight by using your poles, but needs good staking and a flat site. A freestanding tent stands by itself and moves easily. Check whether poles are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Denier and waterproof rating",
    "explanation": "Lower denier fabric weighs less and tears easier, while a higher PU rating resists rain better. A 15D fly is feather-light, and PU5000 is a heavier-duty coating. Look for both numbers on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and floor size",
    "explanation": "A two-person tent gives room for a pack and a partner but weighs more. A one-person tent stays tight and light. Read the interior dimensions before choosing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Condensation and ventilation",
    "explanation": "Double-wall tents and vestibule vents reduce moisture inside. Single-wall designs and low pitches build condensation. Look for ventilation windows or mesh doors in the listing."

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake?",
    "a": "Forgetting that a trekking pole tent needs poles. The Underwood Trekking Pole Tent does not include them. Check your pole length too."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the TOMOUNT worth paying more for?",
    "a": "If you want a lighter pole-equipped tent with a 15D fly, yes. The Clostnature 2-Person Tent costs less and offers more floor. Choose by trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pitch a trekking pole tent?",
    "a": "Stake the corners, raise the tent on a pole at least 46 inches long, then stake out the guy lines. The Underwood Trekking Pole Tent listing explains this. Keep the vestibule tight to reduce condensation."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a light tent dry?",
