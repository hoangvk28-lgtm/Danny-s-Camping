export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Jack and stove match",
    "explanation": "A stove jack is an opening, not approval for a stove. The stove maker and tent maker must agree on pipe diameter and clearance. Look for the pipe diameter in the listing and match it to the stove manual."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide risk",
    "explanation": "Burning wood in a tent produces carbon monoxide, which is odorless. Always keep vents open and use a battery CO alarm. This is general safety guidance, not a listing claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Clearance and spark risk",
    "explanation": "Flames and hot pipes ignite fabric. Keep stoves on a fireproof base and a spark arrestor on the chimney. Look for fire-retardant fabric mentions and a fireproof mat."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Size for stove plus gear",
    "explanation": "A stove takes floor and walk space. Allow roughly 15 sq ft for the stove and clearance. Compare the listed square footage with your party size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Condensation control",
    "explanation": "Warm interiors meet cold walls and create drips. Mesh vents and a double wall reduce this. Look for roof vents and mesh windows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "Stove tents run heavier than normal tents, so the stove, pipe and fuel come on top. A tent near 8 pounds suits sled or walk-in trips better than a larger shelter. Check the stated weight and packed size before you buy."

    "q": "What is the biggest hot tent mistake?",
    "a": "Sleeping with the stove burning. Carbon monoxide can build up, so keep vents open and use an alarm."
