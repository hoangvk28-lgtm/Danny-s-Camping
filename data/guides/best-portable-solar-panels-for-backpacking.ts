  {
    "criterion": "Port speed and count",
    "explanation": "A PD or QC3.0 port charges a phone faster than a basic 5V port, and more ports let you share. Output is limited by the panel's total watts. Check each port's rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rain and trail abuse",
    "explanation": "IP68 and IP67 panels survive rain and drops, while IP44 only handles splashes. Backpacks get wet and rubbed, so the rating matters. Look for an IP number on the listing."

  {
    "criterion": "Power bank buffering",
