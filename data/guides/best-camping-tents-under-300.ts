export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Setup type and what it costs",
    "explanation": "Instant frames cost more because the poles are pre-attached, saving 10 to 15 minutes. Inflatable tents replace poles with air beams and need a pump. Match the style to who will be pitching, since heavier frames can need two adults, then check whether the quoted pitch time assumes one person or two."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof rating versus design",
    "explanation": "A 3000mm PU rating handles heavy rain, while 1200mm suits showers. A fully taped fly and welded floor matter as much as the number. Check how far the fly drops and whether seams are taped, so a taped fly with a 3000mm number beats a bigger number on an untaped shell."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Blackout fabric and airflow",
    "explanation": "Blackout coatings block sun but also trap heat and moisture. Compare the number of vents and mesh panels against how hot your trips run. A tent with roof vents is easier to live in during summer, so check for roof vents and plan to open them whenever the afternoon sun is strong."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stove jack safety",
    "explanation": "A stove jack lets a compatible wood stove vent through a heat-resistant port. Use only stoves rated for tents, keep them clear of fabric and never sleep with a stove burning. Run a carbon monoxide alarm inside every tent that has a stove, and keep a fire extinguisher and a clear exit path in mind while heating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Packed size and weight",
    "explanation": "A 129 sq ft inflatable or a 6-person instant cabin can weigh 25 to 40 lb. Measure your trunk and check that the bag fits. Heavy tents suit car camping only, because a bag that will not fit your trunk or roof box makes the tent useless."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a $300 tent worth it over a $150 tent?",
    "a": "Yes if you value time or specific features. The Leisure Impact 6-Person Instant cuts setup to a minute, and the LANGWILL Blackout Pop-Up adds darkness. For basic camping, a $150 cabin may be enough, and the difference mostly shows up in comfort rather than raw durability."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a wood stove in an inflatable tent?",
    "a": "Only in a tent with a stove jack, such as the Generic Inflatable 8-10 Person, and only with a compatible stove. Keep the stove clear of fabric and never leave it burning while asleep. A CO alarm is required."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are blackout tents hotter?",
    "a": "Blackout coatings reduce heat from direct sun, but they also trap heat and humidity. The LANGWILL Blackout Pop-Up has windows and vents to relieve that. Open them at night to keep air moving, though a cool shaded campsite does more to lower the temperature than any fabric."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up an instant tent in wind?",
    "a": "Stake the base corners first, then pop the frame and clip guy lines. The Leisure Impact 6-Person Instant has a pre-attached frame, so staking is the key step. Fasten the fly tightly to avoid flapping, and carry a few extra stakes because gusts can lift the frame while you work."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store an inflatable tent?",
    "a": "Dry it fully, then deflate the beams and roll the tent loosely. Store it in a cool, dry place away from sharp objects. Check beams for leaks before each trip, and never fold it with damp fabric because mildew spreads quickly."
