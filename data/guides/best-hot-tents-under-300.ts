    "description": "The Naturehike Ranch Fire is a double-wall tipi, 10.8 by 10.8 by 6.9 feet, with a mesh inner tent included and a fire-retardant stove jack. The 210T polyester is described as flame retardant, there is a snow skirt and two doors, and the whole set weighs about 10.6 lbs.\n\nCompared with the VEVOR pair it adds the mesh inner tent, so bugs stay out in warm weather and the stove jack is a bonus rather than the whole point. Against the Zoring it is about 5 lbs lighter and gives standing room for 3 to 4 people in a smaller footprint.\n\nIt suits campers who want one tent for both summer trips and winter trips with a stove.

Look on the listing for a named jack, then read the manual before buying a stove."

  {
    "criterion": "Clearance and ventilation",
    "explanation": "Stoves heat tent fabric, so keep a clear gap between the stove and every wall, and leave vents open for airflow. A tall peak helps, and listings that state a peak height make this easy to judge. Check the peak height and vent count before you commit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide safety",
    "explanation": "Any burning stove produces carbon monoxide, which cannot be seen or smelled. Run a battery carbon monoxide alarm inside and never sleep with a stove burning. This is general camping safety guidance, so follow your stove maker's rules as well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Floor size and packed weight",
    "explanation": "Hot tents run 5 to 15 lbs, and a heavier tent usually brings a bigger floor and taller peak. Think about whether you hike in or drive up. Check the listed diameter, the peak height and the weight together."

export const faq = [

    "q": "Can I use any wood stove with a hot tent?",

  {
    "q": "What is the biggest hot tent mistake?",
    "a": "Sleeping with a stove burning or skipping a carbon monoxide alarm. A battery alarm and open vents are basic safeguards. Stove clearance matters too."

  {
    "q": "Is the Naturehike worth the extra money over a VEVOR?",
    "a": "If you want the mesh inner tent and the 6.9 ft peak, yes. The VEVOR 2-Person Hot Tent weighs only 3.4 lbs and costs less. The VEVOR 4-Person Hot Tent gives more floor for the price."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a stove safely in a tipi?",
    "a": "Place the stove on a fire-safe base, run the pipe through the stove jack, and keep the fabric clear of the hot parts. Open the vents and keep a battery carbon monoxide alarm inside. Follow the manual for your tent and stove."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a ground sheet?",
