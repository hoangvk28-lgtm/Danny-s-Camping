export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Steel, aluminum or fiberglass",
    "explanation": "Steel frames are strongest and heaviest, aluminum is lighter and resists rust, and fiberglass is cheapest but flexes. A 35 pound steel canopy stays put in a gust that lifts a 6 pound fiberglass pop-up. Look for the frame material in the title or bullet points, not just the word sturdy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Complete anchor kit",
    "explanation": "A beach tent without anchors is only a sail. Four sandbags, eight steel stakes and four wind ropes can hold a 10 by 10 foot canopy through a steady 15 mph breeze, while a lone set of plastic stakes will not. Check which anchors come with the tent before adding to the cart."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Canopy or enclosed cabin",
    "explanation": "Open canopies move air and fit a crowd but give no privacy or wind break. Enclosed cabins block sand and let you change clothes, though they run hotter. Decide up front whether you want to lounge with a crowd or shelter a small group, because that choice changes which shape is right. Check whether the tent has a zip door and how many sides are solid."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Height at the center",
    "explanation": "Roof height decides whether adults can stand and how hot the air feels at head level. A canopy with an 8.9 foot center feels roomier than a 5 foot cabin. Check the interior height figure if you plan to stand or set up tall chairs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carry weight and packed size",
    "explanation": "A steel 10 by 10 canopy can weigh 35 pounds, while a Lycra one is much lighter. If the walk from parking is more than a couple of hundred yards, weight matters more than size. Look for the packed length so it fits your trunk and your cart."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a steel or aluminum frame matter at the beach?",
    "a": "Yes, because wind and salt air punish weak frames. Steel on the Blue 10x10 Steel Canopy resists bending, and aluminum on the Hqeeun Silver Cabana resists rust. Thin fiberglass flexes and can crack after a few seasons."
  },
  {
    "q": "What do I do if my tent has no anchors?",
    "a": "Add four 10 to 15 pound sandbags or a set of long stakes and wind ropes before heading to the shore. Fill each bag with wet sand and tie it to the leg near the base. Never leave an unanchored canopy standing unattended."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Vinabilia worth more than the Blue canopy?",
    "a": "The Vinabilia One-Push costs more and gives a higher roof and quicker setup. The Blue 10x10 Steel Canopy includes stakes, ropes and sandbags. Pick the Vinabilia for headroom and the Blue canopy when anchoring is the priority."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a 10x10 canopy by myself?",
    "a": "Stand in the middle of the folded frame and pull one side out while holding the center lock. Extend each leg a notch at a time to keep the frame level. Clip the top on, push the center up and finish with the sandbags."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a beach canopy after salt exposure?",
    "a": "Rinse the poles and fabric with fresh water, then dry everything fully before folding. Salt corrodes steel joints and weakens the fabric coating if left in a damp bag. Store it in the carry bag in a cool, dry place."
