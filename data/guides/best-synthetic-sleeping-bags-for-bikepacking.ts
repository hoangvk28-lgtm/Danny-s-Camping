export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Packed volume on the bike",
    "explanation": "A bikepacking roll or seat pack has a fixed volume, and a sleeping bag takes most of it. Synthetic bags pack larger than down bags of similar warmth, so the printed stuff size matters more here than anywhere else. Look for a stuff size in inches on the listing and compare it to the length of your bag or roll."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight carried by the bike",
    "explanation": "Every pound sits on the bike and affects climbing and handling, even if it is not on your back. A bag around 2 to 3 lb is typical for three-season synthetic. Check for a stated total weight, not just a fill weight, because fill alone leaves out the shell and zipper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature rating",
    "explanation": "A bag rated 40 degrees F is meant for cool nights, and one rated 50 degrees F is for warm ones. The rating is a manufacturer figure, so a cold sleeper should plan around a warmer margin. Match the rating to the coldest night on your route and add a liner for cold snaps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Synthetic fill and damp",
    "explanation": "Synthetic insulation keeps most of its warmth when damp, which helps after morning dew or condensation in a small tent. It is bulkier than down, so you pay for that tolerance in packed size. Look for the fill type named in the listing rather than just a warmth label."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Compression and attachment",
    "explanation": "A compression sack and loops let you squeeze the bag and lash it to a handlebar or frame. Without them you can still use a separate dry sack, but the bag will be less tidy. Check for a compression sack in the box and strap loops on the bag."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Why choose synthetic over down for bikepacking?",
    "a": "Synthetic fill keeps insulating when it gets damp from dew or a splash, which down does not. It costs you some packed volume. Many riders accept that for the peace of mind."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a stuff sack replace the included one?",
    "a": "Yes, a separate compression sack can squeeze a bag further. Check that its volume matches your bag before ordering. A sack that is too small can damage the insulation."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 50 degree bag enough?",
    "a": "Only for warm nights. Mornings often run cooler than the evening, so add a liner or layers. A cooler margin is why the Kelty at 40 degrees is a safer all-round choice."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I pack a bag on a handlebar roll?",
    "a": "Compress the bag, put it in a waterproof dry bag, and lash it on with straps. Keep the heaviest items centered. Check clearance for the brakes and your front wheel."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I care for a synthetic bag?",
    "a": "Air it out after each trip and store it uncompressed. Wash it according to the label, since the MalloMe and Amazon Basics are machine washable. A clean bag keeps its loft longer."
